<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before long two bank accounts will beat as
one,&rdquo; Trudy said to Mary Faithful. &ldquo;Tra-la-la-la-la,&ldquo;
humming the wedding march
while the office force of the O&rsquo;Valley Leather Company
listened with expressions ranging from grins to
frowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! Mr. O&rsquo;Valley has just opened his door.&rdquo;
As she was private secretary and general guardian to
Steve O&rsquo;Valley, president of the concern, Miss Faithful&rsquo;s
word usually had a decisive effect.</p>
<p>But Trudy was irrepressible. Besides boarding
at the Faithful home and thus enjoying a certain
intimacy with Mary, she was one of those young
persons who holds a position merely as a means to an
end&ndash;&ndash;the sort who dresses to impress everyone, from
the president of the concern if he is in the matrimonial
or romantic market to the elevator boy if said elevator
boy happens to have a bank account capable of
taking one to all the musical shows and to supper
afterward. Having been by turns a milliner&rsquo;s apprentice,
assistant in a beauty parlour, and cashier in a
business men&rsquo;s restaurant, Truletta Burrows had
acquired a certain chicness enabling her to twist a
remnant of chiffon or straw into a creation and wear
it in impressive contrast with her baby-blue eyes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Titian-red hair. In the majority of cases where a
girl has neither family nor finances she must seek a
business situation in order to win a husband. Trudy
went after her game in no hesitating manner.</p>
<p>She had no intention of becoming one of the
multitude of commercial nuns who inhabit the
United States of America this day&ndash;&ndash;quiet women
with quick eyes, a trifle cold or pensive if analyzed,
severely combed hair, trim tailor suits and mannish
blouses with dazzling neckties as their bit of vanity&ndash;&ndash;the
type that often shoulders half the responsibility
of the firm. Whether achieving a private office and
a nervous stenographer who is disappointed at having
a lady boss is to be preferred to a house-and-garden
career is, like all vital issues, a question for debate.</p>
<p>Neither did Trudy propose to shrivel into a timid,
slave-like type of person kept on the pay roll from
pity or by reason of the fact that initiating a novice
would be troublesome. Such a one was Miss Nellie
Lunk, who sat in a corner of the hall making out
requisition slips and taking care of unwelcome
visitors&ndash;&ndash;a pathetic figure with faded eyes and
scraggly hair, always keeping a posy on her old-style
desk and crocheting whenever there was a lull in
work. Thirty years in business was Miss Lunk&rsquo;s
record, twenty-five in Mark Constantine&rsquo;s office and
five in the employ of Mr. O&rsquo;Valley, that lovable,
piratical Irishman who achieved his success by being
a brilliant opportunist and who, it would seem, ran a
shoestring into a fortune by a wink of his blue eyes.</p>
<p>Trudy knew that Miss Lunk lived alone&ndash;&ndash;the third
story back, where she cooked most of her meals, while
a forlorn canary cheeped a welcome. She possessed
a little talking machine with sentimental records, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
on Sundays she went to a cafeteria for a good, hearty
meal unless cousins asked her to their establishment.
Some day Miss Lunk would find herself in a home
with other no longer useful old people and here she
would stay with her few keepsakes, of which the
world knew nothing and cared less, the cousins
dropping in at intervals to impress upon her how
carefree and fortunate she was!</p>
<p>In conclusion Trudy had decided not to accept the
third choice of the modern business woman, which,
she decided, was Mary Faithful&rsquo;s fate&ndash;&ndash;to give your
heart to a man who never had thought of you and
never would think of you as other than a reliable and
agreeable machine; as someone&ndash;&ndash;should Florida and a
certain Gorgeous Girl named Beatrice Constantine
beckon&ndash;&ndash;who would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. O&rsquo;Valley, I understand what to do. I
arranged the New Haven sale this morning. You
were at the jewellery store to see about Miss Constantine&rsquo;s
ring. So I long-distanced Martin &amp; Newman
and put it through. If the ring is sent in your absence
I know what you have ordered and can return
it if it does not comply with instructions&ndash;&ndash;platinum
set with diamonds, three large stones of a carat each
and the twenty smaller stones surrounding them.
And a king&rsquo;s-blue velvet case with her initials in
platinum. And you want me to discharge Dundee
and divide up his work. Yes, I gave the janitor the
gold piece for finding your pet cane. I&rsquo;ll wire you
every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Steve O&rsquo;Valley had swung jauntily out
of the office, secure in his secretary&rsquo;s ability to meet
any crisis, to have to work alone in the almost garish
office apparently quite content that she was not going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
to Florida, too. Trudy&rsquo;s imagination pictured there
a someone petulant, spoiled, and altogether irresistible
in the laciest of white frocks and a leghorn hat with
pink streamers, at whose feet Steve O&rsquo;Valley offered
some surprise gift worth months of Mary Faithful&rsquo;s
salary while he said: &ldquo;I ran away from work to
play with you, Gorgeous Girl! See how you demoralize
me? Even your father frowned when I
said I was coming. How are you, darling? I don&rsquo;t
give a hang if I make poor Miss Faithful run the shop
for a year as long as you want me to play with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having the advantage of studying Mary Faithful&rsquo;s
position both from the business and family aspects
Trudy had long ago decided that she was not going to
be like her. In no way did she envy Mary&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>Since her dreamer of a father had died and left dependent
upon her her four-year-old brother and a
mother whose chief concern in life was to have the
smartest-looking window curtains in the neighbourhood,
Mary went to work at thirteen with a remnant
of an education. Possessions spelled happiness to
Mrs. Faithful; poetical dreams had been Mr. Faithful&rsquo;s
chief concern, and as an unexpected consequence
their first child had been endowed with
common sense. With Mary at the wheel there had
been just enough to get along with, so they stayed
on in the old-fashioned house while Mrs. Faithful
bewailed Mary&rsquo;s having to work for a living and
not be a lady, as she could have been if her father
had had any judgment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Faithful had become quite happy in her
martyrdom as she was still able to maintain the
starched window curtains. After a conventional
period of mourning she began to relive the past, her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
husband&rsquo;s mistakes, her own girlhood and offers of
marriage&ndash;&ndash;such incidents as these sufficed to keep
her from enjoying the present, while Mary rose from
errand girl to grocery clerk, with night school as a
recreation, from grocery clerk to filing clerk, assistant
bookkeeper, bookkeeper, stenographer, and finally
private secretary to Steve O&rsquo;Valley, one of the war-fortune
kings. And she had given her heart to him
in the same loyal way she had always given her services.</p>
<p>At home Trudy noted that Mary worked round the
house because she liked the change from office routine,
deaf to the complaining maternal voice reciting
past glories in which Mary had no part. If the
parlour furniture with its tidies and a Rogers group in
the front window sometimes got on her nerves she
forced herself to laugh over it and say: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
house, and all she has.&rdquo; She concerned herself far
more with Luke, an active, fair-to-middling American
boy somewhat inclined to be spoiled. Mary had
taken Luke into the office after school hours to keep
a weather eye on him and make him contribute a
stipend to the expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man won&rsquo;t work he should not eat,&rdquo; she informed
him as she proportioned his wage.</p>
<p>Recalling Mary&rsquo;s position at home&ndash;&ndash;though Trudy
rejoiced in her own front room and the comforts of
the household&ndash;&ndash;she shrugged her shoulders in disapproval.
Certainly she could never endure the
same lot in life. For if one man will not love you
why waste time bewailing the fact? Find another.
Mary could have had other suitors. Mr. Tompkins,
the city salesman, and young Elias, of Elias &amp; Son,
had both made brave attempts to plead their cause,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
only to be treated in the same firm manner that Luke
was treated when he hinted of making off to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll spend her life loving Steve O&rsquo;Valley and
slaving for him,&rdquo; Trudy had confided to her dozen
intimate friends, who never repeated anything told
them. &ldquo;And he will spend his life being trampled on
by Beatrice Constantine, and after they are married
she will be meaner than ever to him. But he will love
her all the more. Honest, business men make the
grandest husbands! College professors are lots
harder to get along with&ndash;&ndash;but business men are as
cross as two sticks in their offices and at home they&rsquo;re
so sweet it would melt pig iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first plank in Trudy&rsquo;s platform was to marry a
business man as nearly like Steve O&rsquo;Valley as possible.
The second was&ndash;&ndash;whether or not she had a stunning
home with brick fireplaces&ndash;&ndash;never to spend her days
hanging round them. Her most envied friend lived
in New York, and her life was just one roof garden
after another. She had everything heart could
desire&ndash;&ndash;Oriental rugs, a grandfather&rsquo;s clock, a
mechanical piano, bird-of-paradise sprays for her hat,
a sealskin ulster, and plenty of alimony. And in case
said business man proved unsatisfactory Trudy had
resolved to exchange him for unlimited legal support
at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>But she would not trespass upon Mary&rsquo;s platform,
which consisted of loving Steve O&rsquo;Valley yet knowing
of his love for the Gorgeous Girl, as Mark Constantine
had named his daughter. And of course Mary
must have realized that though she might earn three
thousand a year as private secretary she would
eternally lock her desk at six o&rsquo;clock and trudge home
to her mother and the starched window curtains,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
watch Luke fall in love and scorn her advice, wash
her hemstitched ruffles and black her boots, and keep
her secret as she grew older and plainer of face!</p>
<p>Trudy often tried to decide just how handsome and
how plain Mary was; it was a matter for argument
because the expression of Mary Faithful&rsquo;s eyes
largely determined her charm. She was a sober young
person with thick braids of brown hair and surprising
niceties of dress, sensible shoes, a frill of real lace on her
serge dress, no hint of perfume, no attempt at wearing
party attire for business as the rest of the staff not
only attempted but unfortunately achieved. She
had honest gray eyes, the prophecy of true greatness
in her face with its flexible mouth and prominent
cheek bones, the sort of woman who would be the
mother of great men, tall and angular in build and
walking with an athletic stride offset by a feminine
cry-baby chin and the usual mediocre allotment of
freckles on the usual mediocre nose! Mary Faithful
was not pretty; she was a &ldquo;good-looking thing,&rdquo;
Trudy would usually conclude, glancing in a near-by
mirror to approve of the way her fluff of pink tulle
harmonized with her pink camisole under the tissue-paper
bodice.</p>
<p>Indulging in one of these reveries Trudy suddenly
realized that she had not added the checks on her
desk. She went to work disdainfully, first feeling of
her skirt and waist at the back, slipping a caramel in
her mouth, and making eyes at a clerk who passed her
desk.</p>
<p>Mary came out of her office and stopped before
Trudy accusingly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for these,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so grand out to-day&ndash;&ndash;look at that sunshine!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
May&rsquo;s the hardest month of the year to work; you
just can&rsquo;t help planning your summer clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Constantine is coming to call for Mr.
O&rsquo;Valley and I want his O. K. on those before he
gets away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, don&rsquo;t you think the diamonds he is buying
her are vulgar? A bunch of electric bulbs is what I
call it, I certainly would not permit&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s pencil tapped authoritatively on the desk,
then she signed an order someone brought her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they going to be married at high noon in
church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;June the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky girl! She&rsquo;s older than me; everyone says
so. It&rsquo;s only her money and clothes that has built
her up. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s so much. Her nose is as
flat as a pancake and she rouges something fierce. I
saw them at the theatre and I certainly was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary took the checks out of Trudy&rsquo;s hand and
walked away. Undecided as to her course of action
Trudy hummed a few bars of &ldquo;Moving Man,
Don&rsquo;t Take My Baby Grand&rdquo; and then followed
Mary into her office.</p>
<p>Mary added up the checks without glancing at her
caller. Then she said sharply: &ldquo;I cannot pay out
someone else&rsquo;s money for work that is not done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get a grouch on; it will spread through the
whole plant. When you&rsquo;re cross everybody&rsquo;s cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do your work&ndash;&ndash;for it isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo; She
could not help adding: &ldquo;You think I can smooth over
everything just because you board with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy giggled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wedding in the air, and
spring, and those diamonds! She never works, she
never does anything but spend the money we make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
for her. All she has is a good time, and what&rsquo;s the
use of living if you don&rsquo;t have a good time? I&rsquo;ll have
it if I have to steal it. Oh, you needn&rsquo;t look so
horrified. Steve O&rsquo;Valley almost stole his fortune
just because he had to be a rich man before Constantine
would let him marry his daughter. Anyway, I&rsquo;d
rather have a good time for a few years and then die
than to live to be a hundred and never have an
honest-to-goodness party. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re foolish to-day. If you only wouldn&rsquo;t
wear such low-cut waists and talk to the men! Mr.
O&rsquo;Valley has noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get another job and another boarding
house,&rdquo; Trudy began, defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t last out at either. You need this
sort of a place and our sort of house, you ridiculous
little thing. Besides, you have Gaylord at your beck
and call&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Trudy blushed&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and you seem to
manage to have a pretty good time when all is said
and done. I do feel responsible for you because at
twenty-three you are more scatterbrained than&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish it&ndash;&ndash;than you were at thirteen! Well,
what of it? I&rsquo;m out for a good time and you are always
talking about the right time, I suppose. I&rsquo;ll
take your lecture without weeping and promise to
reform. But don&rsquo;t be surprised at anything I may
do regarding tra-la-la-la-la.&rdquo; She burst into the
wedding march again and vanished, Mary shaking
her head as she prepared to sign off some letters.</p>
<p>Steve O&rsquo;Valley opened the door connecting their
offices, displaying a face as happy as a schoolboy&rsquo;s on
a Christmas holiday. &ldquo;Miss Constantine is downstairs,
I&rsquo;m going to escort her up,&rdquo; he announced,
shutting the door as abruptly as he had opened it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Presently there came into Steve&rsquo;s office someone
who was saying in a light, gay voice: &ldquo;Perfectly awful
old place, Stevuns&ndash;&ndash;as bad as papa&rsquo;s. I hate business
offices; make my head ache. It was Red Cross to-day,
and after that I had to rush to cooking school&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve answered in rapt fashion: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to talk
to Miss Faithful for half a jiffy and then I&rsquo;m free for
the rest of the day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; opening the door of Mary&rsquo;s
office and beckoning to her.</p>
<p>Coming into his office Mary nodded pleasantly at
the Gorgeous Girl, who nodded pleasantly in return
and settled herself in an easy-chair while Steve rehearsed
the things to be attended to the following day
since he was not to be at the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting Miss Faithful ready to run the shop
single-handed,&rdquo; he explained, telling Mary details
which she already knew better than he but to which
she listened patiently, her twilight eyes glancing now
at Beatrice and back again at Steve.</p>
<p>Outside the hum of commerce played the proper
accompaniment to Steve O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s orders and
Mary&rsquo;s thoughts and Beatrice&rsquo;s actions&ndash;&ndash;a jangling
yet accurate rhythm of typewriters and adding
machines and office chatter, pencil sharpeners, windows
being opened, shades adjusted, wastebaskets
dragged into position, boys demanding their telegrams
or delivering the same, phone bells ringing,
voices asking for Mr. O&rsquo;Valley and being told that he
was not in, other voices asking for Miss Faithful and
being told she was not at liberty just now&ndash;&ndash;would
they be seated? Trudy&rsquo;s giggle rose above the hum
at odd intervals, elevators crept up and down, and
outside the spring air escorted the odour of hides and
tallow and what not, grease and machine oil and
general junk from across the courtyard; trucks rumbled
on the cobblestones while workingmen laughed
and quarrelled&ndash;&ndash;a confusing symphony of the business
world. While Steve hurriedly gave his orders
Mary Faithful in almost the panoramic fashion of the
drowning swiftly recalled the incidents of Steve&rsquo;s life
and of the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s and her own as well, forcing
herself mechanically to say yes and no in answer
to his questions and to make an occasional notation.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>The panorama rather bewildered her; it was like
being asked to describe a blizzard while still in it,
whereas one should be sitting in a warm, cheery room
looking impersonally at the storm swirl.</p>
<p>First of all, she thought of Steve O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s Irish
grandfather, by like name, who spent his life in
Virginia City trying to find a claim equal to the
Comstock lode, dying penniless but with a prospector&rsquo;s
optimism that had he been permitted to live
<i>manana</i> surely would have seen the turning of the
tide. Old O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s only son and his son&rsquo;s wife
survived him until their ability to borrow was at an
end and work would have been their only alternative.
So they left a small, black-haired, blue-eyed young
man named Stephen O&rsquo;Valley to battle single-handed
with the world and bring honour to his name.</p>
<p>The first twelve years of the battle were spent in an
orphanage in the Grass Valley, the next four as a
chore boy on a ranch, after which the young man
decided with na&iuml;ve determination that in order to
obtain anything at all worth while he must be fully
prepared to pay its price, and that he desired above
all else to become a rich man&ndash;&ndash;a truly rich man, and
marry a fairy-princess sort of person. And as far as
education was concerned he felt that if he was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
quite so brushed up on his A B C&rsquo;s as he was on
minding his P&rsquo;s and Q&rsquo;s the result would not be half
bad. Unconsciously his attitude toward the world
was a composite of the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius,
the cynical wisdom of Omar Khayyam, and plain and
not to be duplicated Yankee pep.</p>
<p>As Steve planned it he was to leave his mark on the
world and not endure the world&rsquo;s mark upon himself.
This straight-limbed and altogether too handsome
youngster&ndash;&ndash;his grandmother had been a Basque&ndash;&ndash;possessed
the same quality of the fortune hunter as
his grandfather, only he did not propose to do his
prospecting in the mines of Nevada. Following the
general tactics of a Stone Age man&ndash;&ndash;a belief in
muscle and great initiative&ndash;&ndash;Steve found himself at
twenty-four in the city of Hanover and in the employ
of Mark Constantine, a hide-and-leather magnate
who was said to be like all hard-boiled eggs&ndash;&ndash;impossible
to beat. After Steve advanced to the top
notch of his ability he discovered that the only
reason he was not considered as a junior member of
the firm was because he could not buy stock. At
this same time Beatrice Constantine had become
interested in him.</p>
<p>To her mind Steve was different in other ways than
merely being handsome and possessed of physical
strength. And she considered that if he had a fortune
he would be far more wonderful than any of the
young gentlemen of her set who wondered which
would be the lucky chap to lead Constantine&rsquo;s
Gorgeous Girl to the wedding-license bureau.</p>
<p>In the seventeen-year-old patronizing fashion of a
Gorgeous Girl she permitted Steve to see that she was
interested, and Steve with the romance of his Basque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
grandmother and the audacity of his Irish grandfather
immediately thought of what a strange and
wonderful thing it would be if he could by hook or
crook become a rich man all in the twinkling of an
eye, and marry this superior, elegant little person.</p>
<p>The Gorgeous Girl had never known anything but
the most gorgeous side of life. Her father, self-made
from a boyhood as poor as Steve&rsquo;s, carved his way to
the top without delay or remorse for any one he may
have halted or harmed in the so doing. He had
wisely married a working girl whom he loved in undemonstrative
fashion, and when at the turning
point of his career she bore him a daughter and then
died he erected an expensive monument to her
memory and took his oath that their daughter
should be the most gorgeous girl in Hanover and that
her life should be spent in having as good a time as
her father&rsquo;s fortune allowed. He then invited his
widowed sister to live with him and take charge of his
child.</p>
<p>After this interlude he returned to his business
grimmer of face and harsher of heart, and the world
was none the wiser regarding his grief for the plain-faced
woman in the churchyard. As his fortune
multiplied almost ironically he would often take
time to think of his wife Hannah, who was so tired of
pots and pans and making dollars squeal so that he
might succeed and who was now at rest with an
imposing marble column to call attention to the fact.</p>
<p>So the Gorgeous Girl, as Hanover called her, half in
ridicule and half in envy, developed into a gorgeous
young woman, as might be expected with her father
to pay her bills and her Aunt Belle to toddle meekly
after her. Aunt Belle, once married to a carpenter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
who had conveniently died, never ceased to rejoice in
her good fortune. She was never really quite used to
the luxury that had come to her instead of to the
woman in the churchyard. She revelled in Beatrice&rsquo;s
clothes, her own elaborate costumes, ordered the servants
about, went to Florida and the Bermudas
whenever the Gorgeous Girl saw fit, rolled about the
country in limousines, and secretly admired the
hideous mansion Constantine had built&ndash;&ndash;an ornate,
overbearing brick affair with curlicue trimmings and
a tower with a handful of minor turrets. It was
furnished according to the dictates of a New York
decorator, though Constantine added several large
pieces of village colour after the decorator had pronounced
his work as ended.</p>
<p>Hannah had always planned for a red-velvet cozy
corner, and Constantine didn&rsquo;t give a dozen damns
if they were out of date&ndash;&ndash;a red velvet cozy corner
was going to be installed in the blue drawing room.
A Swiss music box was another thing Hannah had
hankered after&ndash;&ndash;spoken of just before she died&ndash;&ndash;so the
Swiss music box was given a place of honour beside
the residence pipe organ, and likewise some draperies
with plush tassels. The decorator, having his check,
did not attempt to argue, since his clientele were not
apt to stop off at Hanover and discover the crime.</p>
<p>Aunt Belle saw that Beatrice had a governess, a
dancing teacher, more party frocks than any other
little girl in Hanover, and later on a French maid and
other accessories necessary to being a Gorgeous Girl.
In reality a parasitical little snob, hopelessly self-indulged,
though originally kind-hearted and rather
clever; and utterly useless but unconscious of the fact.
She was sent to a finishing school, after which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
thought it would be more fun to go abroad to another
finishing school and study music and art, travelling
summers instead of having a formal d&eacute;but.
Most of her chums were doing this and so she went
with them. The red velvet cozy corner and the
music box and so on disappeared immediately upon
her first return visit. Likewise Beatrice succeeded
finally in dissuading Aunt Belle from wearing her
jewellery while travelling, though that outspoken lady
never could refrain from vivid descriptions of it to
her fellow passengers.</p>
<p>After the European sojourn the Gorgeous Girl
went in for Hanover society and proved herself a
valuable asset. She was nearly twenty-four, almost
as slight of figure as a child, as dainty as Watteau&rsquo;s
most delicate imaginings, with tiny, nondescript
features, lovely sunshine hair, and big dove-coloured
eyes with pale-gold lashes. Meantime, the question
of a husband for this lovely young person was before
the household. She had had a dozen offers of
marriage but accepted none of them because she had
plenty of time and loads of money and she wanted to
make the best of her unencumbered youth as long as
possible. Besides, it was now considered great fun
to go in for charities, she was ever so busy serving on
committees, she never had a moment for herself, and
it would take months to plan a trousseau and a
wedding and decide about her house. Most important
of all was the fact that when she was about to
go to the French finishing school she had told Steve
O&rsquo;Valley that if he did not come to her farewell
party she would be quite hurt. She felt he did not
appreciate the honour in having been asked.</p>
<p>Steve, who would have lain down and let her walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
over him roughshod, said simply: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m poor.
I&rsquo;m not in a position to meet your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be rich&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;ll ask you again,&rdquo; she
challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were a rich man&ndash;&ndash;would you let me try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And she disappeared before
he realized she had practically said yes.</p>
<p>Characteristically Steve lost no time. He went to
her father the day after she had sailed, having sent
her a veritable washtub of flowers for bon voyage&ndash;&ndash;and
said briefly: &ldquo;I have loved your daughter
ever since I first saw her. I&rsquo;m as poor as you were
once, but if I see my way to making a fortune and
can give her everything she ought to have will you
oppose my efforts to make her marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daring of the thing pleased Constantine to the
point of saying: &ldquo;Do you want a loan, O&rsquo;Valley? I
think you&rsquo;ll make good. Then it&rsquo;s up to my daughter;
she knows whom she wants to marry better than I do.
You&rsquo;re a decent sort&ndash;&ndash;her mother would have liked
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a loan just yet. I want to make her
marry me because I have made my own money and
can take care of my own wife. I&rsquo;m just asking you
not to interfere if I do win out. I&rsquo;ve saved a little&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
going to take a plunge in stocks and draw out
before it&rsquo;s too late. Then I&rsquo;m going into business if
I can; but I&rsquo;ll have to try my luck gambling before I
do. When I hang out my shingle I may ask you to
help&ndash;&ndash;a little. Self-made men of to-day are made on
paper&ndash;&ndash;not by splitting logs or teaching school in
the backwoods in order to buy a dictionary and law
books&ndash;&ndash;we haven&rsquo;t the time for that. So I&rsquo;ll take
my chances and you&rsquo;ll hear from me later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>While Beatrice was skimming through school and
taking walking trips through Norway punctuated by
fleeting visits home, remaining as childish and unconcerned
as to vital things as her mother had been
at fourteen, Steve left the Constantine factory and
took the plunge.</p>
<p>Good luck favoured him, and for five golden years
he continued to rise in the financial world, causing
his rivals to say: &ldquo;A fool&rsquo;s luck first then the war
made him&ndash;&ndash;the government contracts, you know.
He&rsquo;s only succeeded because of luck and the fact of
it&rsquo;s being the psychological moment. Worked in the
ordnance game&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t see active service&ndash;&ndash;money
just kept rolling in. Well, who wants a war fortune?
Some folks in 1860 bought government mules for
limousine prices and sold them for the same. Besides,
it&rsquo;s only so he can marry the Gorgeous Girl. I
guess he&rsquo;ll find out it was cheap at half the price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While talk ran riot Steve&rsquo;s fortune multiplied with
almost sinister speed. He learned that flattery and
ridicule were the best weapons known to man. And
while the Gorgeous Girl flew home at the first war
cloud to bury herself in serious war activities Steve
climbed the upward path and never once glanced
backward lest he grow dizzy.</p>
<p>At thirty-two, in the year 1919, he was able to say
to Mark Constantine, in the fashion of a fairy-story
hero: &ldquo;I still love your daughter, sir, and I&rsquo;ve made
my fortune. We want to be married. Your blessing,
please.&rdquo; And to himself: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show the worst side
of me to the world so wolves won&rsquo;t come and steal my
precious gold that I had to have in order to win her;
and I&rsquo;ll show my best side to the woman I love, and
that&rsquo;s fair enough!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>With surprising accuracy Mary Faithful&rsquo;s keen
mind, aided by a tender heart, had pieced this
mosaic business and love story together, and as she
finished the panorama she glanced at the Gorgeous
Girl in her mink dolman and bright red straw hat, the
useless knitting bag on her arm, and Steve&rsquo;s engagement
ring blazing away on her finger, and she sighed
unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell Miss Faithful any more,&rdquo; Beatrice
protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she knows about everything,
and it&rsquo;s late&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, lady fair. That&rsquo;s all, Miss Faithful.
Good-night,&rdquo; Steve dismissed her abruptly.</p>
<p>As Mary left the room he was saying tenderly:
&ldquo;What did you do at cooking school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Gorgeous Girl was answering: &ldquo;We made
pistachio fondant; and next week it will be Scotch
broth. It takes an hour to assemble the vegetables
and I dread it. Only half the class were there, the
rest were at Miss Harper&rsquo;s classical-dancing lesson.
That&rsquo;s fun, too. I think I&rsquo;ll take it up next year. I
was just thinking how glad I am papa built the big
apartment house five years ago; it&rsquo;s so much nicer to
begin housekeeping there instead of a big place of
one&rsquo;s own. It&rsquo;s such work to have a house on your
hands. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on. Don&rsquo;t I deserve a single kiss?...
Thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley.&rdquo; Then the door closed.</p>
<p>Mary Faithful picked up her notations. She tried
to comfort herself with the thought that no one
should ever have reason to guess her secret. If all
honest men steal umbrellas and kisses, so do all
honest women fib as to the size of their shoes and the
person they love best of all the world!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Sunday was a much-dreaded day in Mary&rsquo;s
calendar, partly because she surrendered herself
to the maternal monologue of how dreadful
it was to have a daughter in business and not a lady
in a home of her own, and partly because she missed
the office routine and the magical stimulation of
Steve&rsquo;s presence. Besides, Trudy was a thorn in
Mary&rsquo;s flesh and on Sundays the thorn had a chance
to assert herself in particularly unendurable fashion.</p>
<p>For instance&ndash;&ndash;the Sunday morning following the
Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s visit to Steve&rsquo;s office Trudy unwillingly
dragged herself downstairs at half-past ten in a
faded, bescrolled kimono over careless lingerie, her
hair bundled under a partially soiled boudoir cap, and
her feet flopping along in tattered silk slippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, it&rsquo;s Sunday again,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Goodness
me, Mary, I&rsquo;d hate to be as good as you are&ndash;&ndash;always
up and smiling! Why don&rsquo;t you have a
permanent smile put on your face? It would be lots
easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which joke Luke giggled, and Mrs. Faithful,
ensconced in a large rocker behind the starched curtains
so that nothing passing on the street could
escape her eagle, melancholy eye, nodded approval
and added: &ldquo;I should think Mary would lie abed
the one morning she could. But no, she gets Luke
up no matter what the weather is, and flies round like
a house afire. When I was in my father&rsquo;s house I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
never had to lift a finger. Trudy, I wish you could
have seen my bedroom. I had a mahogany four-poster
bed with white draperies, and a dresser to
match the bed, and my father bought me a silver
toilet set when he was in Lexington, Kentucky, one
time. He used to go there to sell horses. I remember
one time I went with him and if I do say so
I was much admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rode horseback those days and I had a dappled-gray
pony named Pet, and everyone said it was just
like looking at a picture to see me go prancing by.
Of course I never thought about it. I wore a black
velvet riding habit with a long train and a black velvet
hat with a white plume just floating behind, and I
had white gauntlets, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, Trudy wants her coffee. Hot cakes? Oh,
pshaw, they won&rsquo;t hurt you a mite. I was raised on
&rsquo;em. I guess I&rsquo;ll have another plateful, Mary, while
you&rsquo;re frying &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m so comfortable I hate to get
up.... You poor little girls having to go out
and hustle all week long and not half appreciated!
Never mind, some Prince Charming will come and
carry you off sometime.&rdquo; Whereat she waddled to
the table to wait for the hot cakes to arrive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Faithful had pepper-and-salt-coloured hair
and small dark eyes that snapped like an angry
bird&rsquo;s, and a huge double chin. Her nondescript
shape resolved itself into a high, peaked lap over
which, when not eating hot cakes, her stubby hands
seemed eternally clasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary takes after her pa, poor child,&rdquo; she had told
Trudy confidentially. &ldquo;Lean and lank as a clothes
pole! And those gray eyes that look you straight
through. I wish she didn&rsquo;t think so much of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
office and would get a nice young man. I&rsquo;d like to
know what it is in those books she finds so fascinating.
Can you tell me? I tried to read Omar Canine myself
but it was too much for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no highbrow,&rdquo; Trudy had laughed. &ldquo;Mary
is; and a fine girl, besides,&rdquo; she had added, resentfully.</p>
<p>With all Trudy&rsquo;s shallow nature and shrewd
selfishness she was as fond of Mary as she was capable
of being fond of any one. Besides, it was more comfortable
to be a member of the Faithful household
for nine dollars a week and be allowed hot cakes and
sirup &agrave; la kimono on Sunday morning; to have Gaylord
Vondeplosshe, her friend, frequent the parlour at
will; to use the telephone and laundry, and to occupy
the best room in the house than to have to tuck into
a room similar to Miss Lunk&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;and she was truly
grateful to Mary for having taken her in. She felt
that Mrs. Faithful underestimated her man of the
family.</p>
<p>Mary at the present time earned forty dollars a
week. Out of this she supported her family and
saved a little. At regular intervals she tried persuading
her mother to leave the old-fashioned house and
move into a modern apartment, which would give
her the opportunity of dispensing with Trudy as a
boarder. But her mother liked Trudy, with her airs
and graces, her beaux, her startling frocks. Trudy
was company; Mary was not. She was the breadwinner
and a wonderful daughter, as Mrs. Faithful
always said when callers mentioned her. But the
mother had never been friends with her children nor
with their father. So Mary had grown up accustomed
to work and loneliness; and, most important
of all, accustomed to considering everyone else first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and herself last. It was Mary who saw beneath the
boisterousness of Luke&rsquo;s boy nature and spied the
good therein, trying to develop it as best she could.
Aside from Luke and her business she found amusement
in her dream life of loving Steve O&rsquo;Valley and
vicariously sharing his joys and sorrows, safeguarding
his interests.</p>
<p>She had told herself four years ago: &ldquo;You
clumsy, thin business woman&ndash;&ndash;the idea of halfway
dreaming that such a man as Steve would ever love
you! Of course he&rsquo;s intended for the Gorgeous Girl;
the very law of opposites makes him care for her&ndash;&ndash;pretty,
useless doll. So take your joy in being his
business partner, because the Gorgeous Girl can
never share the partnership any more than you could
share his name; and there&rsquo;s a heap of comfort in being
of some use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which self-inflicted homily Mary had set to
work and followed her own advice. She had discovered
very shortly that there were many things to
enjoy and be thankful for.</p>
<p>As soon as she was able Mary had refurnished her
father&rsquo;s study and taken it for her own. Here she
made out household bills, lectured Luke, planned
work, sewed, and read. It was a shabby, cheery room
with a faded old carpet, an open fireplace, some easy-chairs,
and a black-walnut secretary over which her
father had dreamed his dreams. On the walls were
stereotyped engravings such as Cherry Ripe and The
Call to Arms, which Mrs. Faithful refused to part
with; no one, herself included, ever knowing just why.</p>
<p>Mary also took herself to task in the little study
in as impersonal a manner as a true father confessor.
&ldquo;You are twenty-six and growing set in your ways,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
she would mentally accuse&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;always wanting a certain
table at the caf&eacute; and a certain waitress. Old
Maid! Must have your little French book to read
away at as you munch your rolls and refuse to be
sociable. Hermitess! And always buy chocolates
and a London <i>News</i> on Saturday night. Getting so
you fuss if you have square-topped hairpins instead
of round, and letting milliners sell you any sort of
hats because you are too busy to prink! Going to
art galleries and concerts alone&ndash;&ndash;and quite satisfied
to do so. Now, please, Mary, try not to be so queer
and horrid!&rdquo; Followed by a one-sided debate as to
whether or not these were normal symptoms of
maturity, and if she were mistress of a house would
she not entertain equally set notions regarding brands
of soap, and so on?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Office notions are not so nice as the frilly,
cry-on-a-shoulder-when-the-biscuits-burn notions,&rdquo; she would
end, dolefully. &ldquo;Fancy my tall self weeping on the
superintendent&rsquo;s shoulder because a cablegram has
gone astray! Making women over into commercial
nuns is a problem&ndash;&ndash;some of us take it easily and
don&rsquo;t try to fight back, some of us fight and end
defeated and bitter, and some of us don&rsquo;t play the
game but just our own hand&ndash;&ndash;like Trudy. And
what&rsquo;s the square game for a commercial nun? That
is what I&rsquo;d like to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would then find herself dreaming of two distinct
forks in the road, both of which might be possible
for her but only one of which was probable.
Each fork led to a feminine rainbow ending.</p>
<p>The more probable fork would resolve itself, a few
years hence, into a trim suburban bungalow with a
neat roadster to whisk her into business and whisk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
her away from it. The frilly, cry-on-a-shoulder-when-the-biscuits-burn
part of Mary would have long
ago vanished, leaving the business woman quite serene
and satisfied. She would find her happiness in mere
things&ndash;&ndash;in owning her home; in facing old age single-handed
and knowing it would not bring the gray
wolf; in helping Luke through college while her
mother was in a comfy orthodox heaven with plenty
of plates of hot cakes and dozens of starched window
curtains; in rejoicing at some new possession for her
living room, at her immaculate business costumes,
new books, tickets for the opera season; in vacationing
wherever she wished, sometimes with other commercial
nuns and sometimes alone; in having that
selfish, tempting freedom of time and lack of personal
demands which permit a woman to be always well
groomed and physically rested, and to take refuge in
a sanitarium whenever business worries pressed too
hard. To sum it up: it meant to sit on the curbstone&ndash;&ndash;a
nice, steam-heated, artistically furnished
curbstone, to be sure, and have to watch the procession
pass by.</p>
<p>The other fork in the road led to a shadowy rainbow
since Mary knew so little concerning it. It
comprised the exacting, unselfish role of having baby
fingers tagging at her skirts and shutting her away
from easy routines and lack of responsibility; of
having a house to suit her family first and herself last;
of growing old and tired with the younger things
growing up and away from her, and the strong-shouldered
man demanding to be mothered, after the
fashion of all really strong-shouldered and successful
men&ndash;&ndash;requiring more of her patience and love than
all the young things combined; of subordinating her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
personality, perhaps her ideas, and most certainly
her surface interests. To be that almost mystical
relation, a wife; which includes far more than having
Mrs. Stephen O&rsquo;Valley&ndash;&ndash;just for example&ndash;&ndash;on a calling
card.</p>
<p>To her lot would fall the task of always being there
to welcome the strong man with tender joy when he
has succeeded or to comfort him with equal tenderness
when he has failed, and at all times spurring him
to live up to the ideal his wife has set for him. To
stay aloof from his work inasmuch as it would annoy
him, yet to be adviser emeritus, whether the matter
involved hiring a new sweeper-out or moving the
whole plant to the end of the world. Someone who
ministered to the needs of the strong man&rsquo;s very soul
in unsuspected, often unconscious and unthanked
fashion; such a trifle as a rose-shaded lamp for tired
eyes; a funny bundle of domestic happenings told
cleverly to offset the jarring problems of commerce; a
song played by sympathetic fingers; a little poem
tucked in the blotter of the strong man&rsquo;s desk, an
artful praising of the strong man&rsquo;s self!</p>
<p>Mary realized this latter fork was not probable&ndash;&ndash;nor
was she unhappy because of it. She sometimes
retired to her study to vow eternal wrath upon Trudy
Burrows for having attached herself to the household;
or to pray that her mother be enlightened to the
extent of moving; but beyond an occasional &ldquo;mad
on,&rdquo; as Luke said, Mary viewed life from the angle of
the doughnut and not that of the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish someone else would try baking these
greasy things,&rdquo; she said, coming in with another
plateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you slip on a kimono instead of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
starched house dress, Mary? Whoever is spick-and-span
on Sunday morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get Mary to lecturing,&rdquo; Mrs. Faithful
warned between bites. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make us all go to
church if we&rsquo;re not careful. Are you going out with
Gay to-day, Trudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I&rsquo;m awfully mad at him, too. It&rsquo;s
fierce the way he gambles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too harsh; it&rsquo;s a mistake to nag too much
beforehand. He&rsquo;s a lovely young man and I wish
Luke could have one of those green paddock coats.
I always like a gentleman&rsquo;s coat with a sealskin
collar, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s paid for.&rdquo; Trudy&rsquo;s eyes darkened. &ldquo;Just
because Gay comes of a wonderful family he thinks
he has the keys to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lovely young man,&rdquo; Mrs. Faithful reiterated.
&ldquo;Oh, what did Beatrice Constantine wear
when she came down to the office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes.&rdquo; Mary was deep in the Sunday paper
art section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked like a Christmas tree on fire,&rdquo; Luke
supplemented. &ldquo;Lovely butter-coloured hair she
has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do. She is very nice, but different from
our sort.&rdquo; Mary glanced up from her paper.</p>
<p>Trudy bridled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s no different; she has
money. My things have as much style. Gaylord
knows her intimately, and he says she is a wretched
dancer and pouts if things don&rsquo;t please her. The
best tailors and modistes in the country make her
things. Who wouldn&rsquo;t look well? If I had one
tenth of her income I&rsquo;d be a more Gorgeous Girl than
she is&ndash;&ndash;and don&rsquo;t I wish I had it! Oh, boy! Why,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
that girl has her maid, the most wonderful jewellery
you ever saw, two automobiles of her own and a
saddle horse, and her father owns the best apartment
house in town, and Beatrice is going to have the best
apartment in it when she marries Steve. And you
can just bet she knew she was going to marry him a
long time ago&ndash;&ndash;because she knew he&rsquo;d rob the Bank of
England to get a fortune. She&rsquo;s flirted with everyone
from an English nobleman to the Prince of Siam, and
now she&rsquo;s marrying the handsomest, brightest, most
devoted cave man in the world.&rdquo; Trudy glanced at
Mary. &ldquo;Yet she doesn&rsquo;t really care for him, she
just wants to be married before she is considered
pass&eacute;e.&rdquo; Trudy was very proud of her occasional
French. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be twenty-six her next birthday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, girls take their time these days; I was
eighteen the day Mr. Faithful led me to the altar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to get married?&rdquo; Luke asked
Trudy with malice aforethought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give Mary a chance. She don&rsquo;t want to
dance in the pig trough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary laid down the paper. &ldquo;I wish you people
would finish eating. Luke, are you going fishing
with me out at the old mill? Then you better get the
walks swept. We&rsquo;ll be home in time for dinner,
mother. I&rsquo;ll leave the things as nearly ready as I
can. How about you, Trudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay wants me to go to the Boulevard Caf&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;they
dance on Sunday just the same as weekdays&ndash;&ndash;and
then we&rsquo;ll do a movie afterward. I suppose Steve
and his Beatrice are now revelling in the Constantine
conservatory, with Steve walking on all fours to
prove his devotion. Why is it some girls have
everything? Look at me&ndash;&ndash;no one cares if I live or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
die. First I had a stepmother, and then I tried
living with a great-aunt, and then I went to work.
Here I am still working, and a lot of thanks I get for
it. I&rsquo;d like to see the Gorgeous Girl have to work&ndash;&ndash;well,
I would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary brushed by with some dishes. Whereupon
Trudy settled herself in an easy-chair and ran
through the supplement sections, discussing the
latest New York scandal with Mrs. Faithful. The
next thing on Trudy&rsquo;s Sunday program was washing
out &ldquo;just a few little things, Mary dear; and have you
a bit of soap I could borrow and may I use the electric
iron for half a jiffy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently there were hung on the line some dabs of
chiffon and lace, and Trudy, taking advantage of her
softened cuticle, sat down and did her nails, Mrs.
Faithful admiring the high polish she achieved and
reading Advice to the Anxious aloud for general
edification.</p>
<p>After ironing the few little things Trudy shampooed
her hair with scented soap and by the time its reddish
loveliness was dry it was high noon and she repaired
to her bedroom to mend and write letters. At one
o&rsquo;clock, in the process of dressing, she rapped at
Mary&rsquo;s door and asked to borrow a quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly poor this week and if I should have a
quarrel with Gay I want to have enough carfare to
come home alone&ndash;&ndash;you know how we scrap,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock there emerged from the front
bedroom an excellent imitation of the Gorgeous Girl.
Trudy had not exaggerated when she boasted of her
own style. Though patronizing credit houses exclusively
and possessing not a single woollen garment nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
a penny of savings, she tripped down the stairs in
answer to Luke&rsquo;s summons, a fearful, wonderful little
person in a gown of fog-coloured chiffon with a violet
sash and a great many trimmings of blue crystal
beads. She boasted of a large black hat which
seemed a combination of a Spanish scarf and a South
Sea pirate&rsquo;s pet headgear, since it had red coral earrings
hanging at either side of it. Over her shoulders
was a luxurious feline pelt masquerading comfortably
under the title of spotted fox. White kid boots,
white kid gloves, a silver vanity case, and a red satin
rose at her waist completed the costume.</p>
<p>Standing in the offing, about to decamp with Mary,
Luke gave a low whistle to tip her off to look out the
window and not miss it. Mrs. Faithful was peeking
from behind the starched window curtains as there
glided before her eyes the most elegant young woman
and impressive young man ever earning fifteen dollars
and no dollars a week respectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do they do it?&rdquo; Mary sighed. &ldquo;Come, Luke,
let&rsquo;s get on the trail of something green and real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later there hurried along the same
pathway a tall young woman in an old tailored suit
which impressed one with the wearer&rsquo;s plainness.
Instead of a silver vanity case she was laden with a
basket of newspapers, string, and a garden trowel, indicating
that fern roots would be the vogue shortly.
Shouldering fishing tackle Luke turned his freckled
face toward Mary as they began a conversation, and
his perpetual grin was momentarily replaced by an
expression of respect. At least his sister was not like
the average woman, who depends solely on her
clothes to make her interesting.</p>
<p>Meantime, Trudy and Gaylord Vondeplosshe were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
beginning their Sunday outing by walking to the
corner in silence&ndash;&ndash;the usual preliminary to a dispute.
Gaylord was quite Trudy&rsquo;s equal as to clothes, not
only in style but in forgetfulness to pay for them.
Still, he was not unusual after one fully comprehended
the type, for they flourished like mushrooms.
His had been a rich and powerful family&ndash;&ndash;only-the-father-drank-you-see
variety&ndash;&ndash;the sort taking the
fastest and most expensive steamer to Europe and
bringing shame upon the name of American traveller
after arriving. Gaylord had been the adored and
only son, and his adored and older sister had managed
to marry fairly well before the crash came and debts
surrounded the entire Vondeplosshe estate.</p>
<p>He was small and frail, a trifle bow-legged to be
exact, with pale and perpetually weeping eyes, a
crooked little nose with an incipient moustache doing
its best to hide a thick upper lip. His forehead
sloped back like a cat&rsquo;s, and his scanty, sandy hair
was brushed into a shining pompadour, while white
eyelashes gave an uncanny expression to his face.
Abortive lumps of flesh stuck on at careless intervals
sufficed for ears, and his scrawny neck with its absurdly
correct collar and wild necktie seemed like an
old, old man&rsquo;s when he dresses for his golden-wedding
anniversary. Everything about Gaylord seemed old,
exhausted, quite ineffectual. His mother had never
tired boasting that Gaylord had had mumps, measles,
chicken pox, whooping cough, St. Vitus dance, double
pneumonia, and typhoid, had broken three ribs, his
left arm, his right leg, and his nose&ndash;&ndash;all before reaching
the age of sixteen. And yet she raised him!</p>
<p>Coupled with this and the fact of his father&rsquo;s
failure people were lenient to him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Vondeplosshe&rsquo;s boy,&rdquo; they said; so they gave
him a position or a loan or a letter of introduction,
and thought at the same time what a splendid thing
it was Vondeplosshe was out of it instead of having to
stand by and see his son make a complete foozle.
For some time Gaylord had been scampering up and
down the gauntlet of sympathy, and as long as he
could borrow more money in Hanover than he could
possibly earn he refused to go to work.</p>
<p>Originally he would have been almost as rich as the
Gorgeous Girl herself, but as it was he was poor as
Trudy Burrows, only Trudy was a nobody, her
family being a dark and uncertain quantity in the
wilds of Michigan.</p>
<p>Whereas Gaylord was Vondeplosshe and he could&ndash;&ndash;and
did&ndash;&ndash;saunter past a red-brick mansion and
remark pensively: &ldquo;I was born in the room over the
large bay window; the one next to it was my nursery&ndash;&ndash;a
dear old spot. Rather tough, old dear, to have
to stand outside!&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;Father was a charter
member of the club, so they carry me along without
dues. Decent of them, isn&rsquo;t it? Father was a prince
among men, robbed right and left, y&rsquo;know&ndash;&ndash;always
the way when a gentleman tries to be in business.
Some say it was Constantine himself who did the
worst of it. Of course never repeat it, will you? It
takes a man with Steve O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s coarseness to forge
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wobbly, rickety little body always wore the
most startling of costumes. A green paddock coat,
well padded, a yellow walking stick in the thin fingers,
a rakish hat, patent-leather boots, striped suits, silk
shirts with handkerchiefs to match, a gold cigarette
case, and a watch chain like a woman&rsquo;s, were a few of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
Gaylord&rsquo;s daily requisites. He lived at a club called
The Hunters of Arcadia, where he paid an occasional
stipend and gambled regularly, sometimes winning.
He also promoted things in half-dishonest, half-idiotic
fashion, undertaking to bring on opera singers for a
concert, sometimes realizing a decent sum and sometimes
going behind only to be rescued by an old
family friend.</p>
<p>Gaylord was always keen on dinner invitations.
And because he was a son of Vondeplosshe the same
family friends endured his conceited twaddle and his
knock-kneed, wicked little self, and sighed with relief
when he went away. It would be so much easier to
send these dethroned sons of rich men a supply of
groceries and an order for coal!</p>
<p>Besides these lines of activity Gaylord wrote
society items for the paper, and as he knew everyone
and everything about them he was worth a stipend to
the editor. He was considered a divine dancer by
the buds, and counted as a cutey by widows. But
his standing among creditors was: If he offered a
check for the entire amount or a dollar on account,
pass up the check!</p>
<p>Steve had destroyed several IOU&rsquo;s with Gaylord&rsquo;s
name attached for the sole reason that Gay had been
a playmate of Beatrice&rsquo;s and she rather favoured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so convenient,&rdquo; she had defended. &ldquo;You
can always call him up at the last minute if someone
has disappointed for cards or dinner, and he is never
busy. He can shop with you as well as a woman,
lunch with you, dance with you&ndash;&ndash;and he does know
the proper way to handle small silver. Besides, he
loves Monster.&rdquo; Monster was Bea&rsquo;s pound-and-a-half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
spaniel, which barked her wonder at the silken
beauty of Beatrice&rsquo;s boudoir.</p>
<p>So Gaylord travelled his own peculiar gait, with his
married sister occasionally sending him checks; as
busy as a kitten with a ball of yarn in making everyone
tolerate though loathing him. When he visited
Steve&rsquo;s office in the first flush of Steve&rsquo;s success, to
ask the thousandth favour from him, and spied
Trudy Burrows in all her lemon-kid booted, pink-chiffon
waisted, red-haired loveliness&ndash;&ndash;as virile and
bewitching as any one Gaylord&rsquo;s pale little mind
could picture&ndash;&ndash;he proved himself a &ldquo;true democrat,&rdquo;
as he boasted at the club, and offered her his hand in
marriage in short order.</p>
<p>Having just despaired of winning a moneyed bride
Gaylord chose Truletta, reasoning that if she were a
little nobody it would give him the whiphand over
her, since she would feel that to marry a Vondeplosshe
was no small triumph. Besides, a chic red-haired
wife who knew how to make the most of nothing and
to smile, showing thirty-two pearly teeth as cleverly
as any dental ad, would not be a bad asset among his
men friends. Had the Vondeplosshe fortunes remained
intact and Gay met Trudy he would still have
pressed his attentions upon her, though they might
not have taken the form of an offer of marriage.
Trudy&rsquo;s virile, magnetic personality would have commanded
this weakling&rsquo;s attention and admiration at
any time and in any circumstances&ndash;&ndash;which is the
way of things.</p>
<p>Very wisely Trudy kept the engagement somewhat
of a secret. She estimated that by being seen with
Gay she might meet a not impoverished and real
man; and Gay&ndash;&ndash;who still hoped for an heiress to fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
madly in love with him&ndash;&ndash;was willing to let the matter
be a mere understanding. So this oversubscribed
flirt and this underendowed young gentleman had
been waiting for nearly two years for something to
live on in order to be married or else two new affinities
in order that they might part amicably.</p>
<p>They did not speak until they were in the caf&eacute;,
where it looked well for Gaylord to be attentive and
Trudy gracious.</p>
<p>Under the mask of a smile Trudy began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m cross.
You were gambling again&ndash;&ndash;yes, you were! Never
mind how I know. I know!... I&rsquo;ll have
macaroni, ripe olives, and a cream puff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; Gay said, mournfully; adding: &ldquo;Well,
deary, I have to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not work? I do. You sponge along and
waste everyone&rsquo;s time. I&rsquo;m not getting any younger,
and it&rsquo;s pretty rough to be in an office with horrid
people ordering you round&ndash;&ndash;to have to hear all about
Beatrice Constantine and her wonderful wedding.
I&rsquo;m as good as she is&ndash;&ndash;yet I&rsquo;ll not be asked, and you
will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I&rsquo;m her oldest playmate,&rdquo; he
said, proudly.</p>
<p>Trudy&rsquo;s temper jumped the stockade. &ldquo;So, you
paste jewel, you&rsquo;ll go mincing into church and see her
married and dance with everyone afterward; and I&rsquo;ll
sit in the office licking postage stamps while you kiss
the bride! I&rsquo;m better looking than she is; and if you
are good enough to go to that wedding so am I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Trudy,&rdquo; he began, in a bewildered fashion,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t make a scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use making a scene in a fifty-cent caf&eacute;,&rdquo; she
told him, bitterly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m plenty good looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
enough to have a real man buy me a real dinner with
a taxi and wine and violets as extras. Don&rsquo;t think
you are doing me a big favour by being engaged to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re a great little girl,&rdquo; he said, nervously;
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s all going to come out right. It does rile me
to think of your working for Steve. Never mind, my
ship will come in and then we&rsquo;ll show them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twenty-three and you&rsquo;re twenty-six, and my
eyes ache when I work steadily. I&rsquo;ll have to wear
glasses in another year&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;ll wash clothes before
I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it gets that bad we&rsquo;ll be married,&rdquo; he said,
seriously.</p>
<p>The humour passed over Trudy&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Married
on what?&rdquo; She was her prettiest when angry
and she stirred in Gaylord&rsquo;s one-cylinder brain a
resolve to play fairy-godfather husband and somehow
deliver a fortune at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live at your club,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;and
your sister is jealous of her husband and wouldn&rsquo;t
want me round. We couldn&rsquo;t live with the Faithfuls;
Mary&rsquo;s a nice girl but I can&rsquo;t go their quiet
ways. I only stay because it&rsquo;s cheap. I owe more
than two hundred dollars right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaylord was sympathetic. &ldquo;I owe more than
that,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to have some
concerts and there&rsquo;ll be good horse races soon&ndash;&ndash;sure
things, you know. You&rsquo;ll see, little girl. What
would you say if I showed you a real bank account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t waste time talking. I&rsquo;d marry you.&rdquo;
Her good humour was returning. &ldquo;Honest, Gay, do
you think you might draw down some kale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like all her kind she had an absurd trust in any one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
who was paying her attention. With a different type
of man Trudy would have been beaten, courageously
had the gentleman arrested, and then interfered when
the judge was directing him to the penitentiary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk that way. When we are
married and you meet my friends you&rsquo;ll have to brush
up on a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll manage to be understood,&rdquo; she retorted;
&ldquo;and when we are married maybe you can get
my job so as to support your wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orchestra began playing a new rag, and Trudy
and Gay immediately left their chairs to be the first
couple on the floor. They were prouder of their
dancing than of each other.</p>
<p>After several dances they became optimistic over
the future and finished their dinner with the understanding
that at the first possible moment they would
be married and Trudy was to be a hard-working little
bride causing her husband&rsquo;s men friends to be nice to
the Vondeplosshes, while husband would persuade
the Gorgeous Girl to be nice to his wife.</p>
<p>They decided, too, that Mary Faithful was clever
and good&ndash;&ndash;but queer.</p>
<p>That Steve O&rsquo;Valley would discover that a self-made
man could not marry an heiress and make a go
of it as well as a man of an aristocratic family could
marry an adorable red-haired young lady and elevate
her to his position.</p>
<p>That Trudy was far more beautiful than Beatrice
Constantine, and as one lived only once in this world&ndash;&ndash;why
not always strive for a good time?</p>
<p>Whereat they had a farewell dance and moved on
to the moving-picture world, where they held hands
and stared vapidly at the films, repairing to a cafeteria
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
on a side street for a lunch, and then to the
Faithful parlour. Mary had gone to church, Luke
had boy friends in to discuss a summer camp, and his
mother snored mildly on the dining-room sofa.</p>
<p>They took possession of the front parlour, and the
enlarged crayons of the Faithful ancestors bore witness
that for more than two hours these young people
giggled over the comic supplement, debated as to the
private life of the movie stars, tried new dance steps,
and then planned how to get everything for nothing
and, having done so, not to share their spoils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfectly lovely time!&rdquo; Trudy said, glibly, as
she kissed Gay good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly lovely!&rdquo; he echoed, politely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
work too hard to-morrow, Babseley, will you? And
do nothing rash until you see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me up to-morrow at eight, Bubseley,&rdquo; she
giggled. The pet names were of Gay&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>So Bubseley tottered down the walk while Babseley
turned out the lights and retired to her room with a
bag of candy and a paprika-brand of novel. At midnight
she tossed it aside and with self-pity prepared to
go to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll have to go to work to-morrow,&rdquo; she
sighed, planning her next silk dress as she did up the
Titian hair in curlers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>WHEN the world was considerably younger it
dressed children in imitation of its adults&ndash;&ndash;those
awful headdresses and heavy stays,
long skirts to trip up tender little feet, and jewelled
collars to make tiny necks ache. Now that the world
&ldquo;is growing evil and the time is waxing late&rdquo; the
grown-ups have turned the tables and they dress like
the children&ndash;&ndash;witness thereof to be found in the costume
of Aunt Belle Todd, Mark Constantine&rsquo;s sister,
who had shared her brother&rsquo;s fortunes ever since his
wife had been presented with the marble monument.</p>
<p>Like all women who have ceased having birthdays
Aunt Belle had not ceased struggling. She still had
hopes of a financier who would carry her off in a
storm of warmed-over romance to a castle in Kansas.
Her first husband was Thomas Todd, the carpenter,
chiefly distinguished for falling off a three-story
building on which he was working and never harming
a hair of his head; also for singing first bass in the
village quartet. Aunt Belle had slightly recoloured
her past since she had lived with her brother. The
account of Mr. Todd&rsquo;s singing in the quartet was
made to resemble a brilliant d&eacute;but in grand opera
which was abandoned because of Aunt Belle&rsquo;s dislike
of stage life and its temptations, while his rolling off
the three-story building was never alluded to except
when Mark Constantine wished to tease.</p>
<p>She was a short, plump person with permanently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
jet-black hair and twinkling eyes. Prepared to forgo
all else save elegance, she had brought up her gorgeous
niece with the idea that it was never possible to
have too much luxury. Seated in the Gorgeous
Girl&rsquo;s dressing room she now presented excellent
proof that the world was growing very old indeed,
for her plump self was squeezed into a short purple
affair made like a pinafore, her high-heeled bronze
slippers causing her to totter like a mandarin&rsquo;s wife;
and strings of coral beads and a gold lorgnette rose
and fell with rhythmic motion as she sighed very
properly over her niece&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will never be the same, darling,&rdquo; she was saying,
glancing in a mirror to see if the light showed the
rouge boundaries too clearly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;never quite the same.
You&rsquo;ll understand when your daughter marries&ndash;&ndash;for
you have been just as dear as one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice, who was busy inspecting some newly
arrived lingerie, did not glance up as she answered:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. You know it&rsquo;s a relief. You can
sit back and rest from now on&ndash;&ndash;until I&rsquo;m divorced,&rdquo;
she added with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you even say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice tossed the filmy creamy silk somethings
or other away and delivered herself of her mind.
&ldquo;Alice Twill was divorced before she married this
specimen; so was Coralie Minter; and Harold Atwater;
and both the Deralto girls were divorced, and
their mother, too. And Jill Briggs is considering it,
and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t blame her. Everyone seems to
think a divorce quite the proper caper when things
grow dull. You may as well have all the fun you can.
Steve wants me to have everything I fancy, and I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;d never deny me a divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are marrying a splendid, self-made young
man who adores you and who is making money every
day in the week. No girl is to be more envied&ndash;&ndash;you
have had a wonderful ten years of being a &lsquo;Gorgeous
Girl,&rsquo; as your dear papa calls it, and at twenty-six you
are to become the bride of a wonderful man&ndash;&ndash;neither
too early nor too late an age. I cannot really
grieve&ndash;&ndash;when I realize how happy you are going to be,
and yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t work so hard, aunty,&rdquo; Bea said, easily. &ldquo;Of
course Steve&rsquo;s a wonderful old dear and all that&ndash;&ndash;I
wish I had asked him for the moon. I do believe he&rsquo;d
have gotten an option on it.&rdquo; She laughed and
reached over to a bonbon dish to rummage for a
favourite flavour. She selected a fat, deadly looking
affair, only to bite into it and discover her mistake.
She tossed it on the floor so that Monster could creep
out of her silk-lined basket and devour the remains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you call natural feelings of a mother and an
aunt &lsquo;working hard&rsquo; I am at a loss&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her aunt
began with attempted indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t call anything anything; I&rsquo;m dead and
almost buried.&rdquo; She looked at her small self in the
pier glass. &ldquo;Think of all I have to go through with
before it is over and we are on our way west. Here it
is half-past twelve and I&rsquo;ve not eaten breakfast really.
I&rsquo;m so tired of presents and bored with clothes that
I cannot acknowledge another thing or decide anything.
I think weddings are a frightful ordeal. Did
you know the women on my war-relief committee
presented me with a silver jewel box? Lovely of them,
wasn&rsquo;t it? But I deserve it&ndash;&ndash;after slaving all last
winter. My bronchitis was just because I sold tags
for them during that rainy weather.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t seen it. But I am glad you decided
on a church wedding&ndash;&ndash;there is such a difference
between a wedding and just a marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice shoved the box of lingerie away. &ldquo;Those
are all wrong, so back they go; and I can&rsquo;t help it if
that woman does need money, I told her I wanted a
full inch-and-a-half beading and she has put this
crochet edge all round everywhere. I shan&rsquo;t accept
a single piece!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon she sat down at her dressing table and
rang for her maid. Madame Pompadour herself had
no lovelier boudoir than Beatrice. It was replete
with rose-coloured taffeta curtains, padded sky-blue
silk walls with garlands of appliqu&eacute;d flowers. Lace
frills covered every possible object; the ivory furniture
was emphasized by smart rose upholstery, and
the dressing table itself fairly dazzled one by the
array of gold-topped bottles and gold-backed brushes.</p>
<p>Johanna, the maid, began brushing the sunshiny
hair, the Gorgeous Girl stamping her feet as snarls
asserted themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more days before the wedding,&rdquo; she complained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Twill luncheon to-day and a
bridge and tea at Marion Kavanaugh&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;I hate her,
too. She gave me the most atrocious Chinese idol.
I&rsquo;m going to tell her I have no proper place for it, that
it deserves to be alone in a room in order to have it
properly appreciated.&rdquo; She laughed at herself. &ldquo;So
I&rsquo;ll leave it for papa. The apartment won&rsquo;t hold
but just so much&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a tiny affair.&rdquo; She laughed
again, the apartment having only eleven rooms and a
profusion of iron grille work at all the windows.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a wonderful way to start&ndash;&ndash;in an apartment&ndash;&ndash;it
is such a good excuse for not dragging in all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
terrible wedding presents. I can leave everything I
like with papa because he never minds anything as
long as he has old slippers and plenty of mince pie.
After a year or so I&rsquo;m going to have a wonderful
house copied after one I saw in Italy. By then they
will all have forgotten what they gave me and I
can furnish it so we won&rsquo;t have to go about wearing
blinders.... The blue dress, Jody, that&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it to-night?&rdquo; her aunt asked, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Farmsworth dinner; and to-morrow another
luncheon and the garden party at the club. Then
the dinner here, rehearsal; and Wednesday, thank
heaven, it will be all ended!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johanna helped fasten the king&rsquo;s-blue satin with
seed-pearl trimmings and place a trig black hat atilt
on the yellow hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ermine scarf, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gorgeous Girl was slipping matronly looking
rings on her fingers and adding an extra dab of powder.
She took another chocolate, hugged Monster,
gave orders about sending back the lingerie, remarked
that she must send her photograph to the society
editor for the next day&rsquo;s edition, and she thought the
one taken in her Red Cross outfit would be the
sweetest; and then kissing the tip of her aunt&rsquo;s right
ear she sailed downstairs and into the closed car to be
whirled to Alice Twill&rsquo;s house, a duplicate of the
Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s. There she was enthusiastically
embraced and there followed a mutual admiration as
to gowns, make-ups, and jewellery, and a mutual sympathy
as to being desperately tired and busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I haven&rsquo;t had time to breath&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
perfectly awful! I&rsquo;ll have to drop out of things next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
winter. Steve will never allow me to be so overburdened.
I can&rsquo;t sleep unless I take a powder and I
can&rsquo;t have any enthusiasm in the morning unless I
have oodles of black coffee. Of course one has had to
do serious work&ndash;&ndash;thank heavens the war is over!&ndash;&ndash;but
you can&rsquo;t give up all the good times....
What a lovely centre piece! And those cunning
little gilt suitcases for favours! A really truly gold
veil pin in each one? You love! Oh, let&rsquo;s have a
cocktail before any one comes in. It does pick me up
wonderfully.... Thanks.... Yes, I had
breakfast in bed&ndash;&ndash;some coffee and gluten crackers
was all, and aunty had to stay in my room half the
morning trying to be pensive about my wedding!
No, Markham didn&rsquo;t make my travelling suit half as
well as he did Peggy Brewster&rsquo;s. I shall never go
near him again.... And did you hear that Jill
found her diamond pendant in her cold cream jar, so
it wasn&rsquo;t a burglar at all!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Gaylord Vondeplosshe is going to be an
usher.... Well, what else could I do at the
last moment? Wasn&rsquo;t it absurd for a grown man like
Fred Jennings to go have the mumps? Gay knows
everyone and I&rsquo;m sure he is quite harmless....
Oh, Steve is well and terribly busy, you know. He
is giving me the most wonderful present. Papa
hasn&rsquo;t given me his yet and I&rsquo;m dying to know what
it is, he always gives me such wonderful things,
too.... There&rsquo;s the bell. I do hope it isn&rsquo;t
Lois Taylor, because she always wants people to sign
petitions and appear in court. It is Lois Taylor! Why
didn&rsquo;t you leave word to have all petitions checked
with wraps?&rdquo; Giggles. &ldquo;Good heavens, what a
fright of a hat. Well, are you ready to go down?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>Five hours later Beatrice was being dressed for the
evening&rsquo;s frolic, dipping into the bonbon box for a
stray maple cream, and complaining of her headache.
At this juncture her father tiptoed clumsily into her
room and laid a white velvet jewel case on her dressing
table, standing back to watch her open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began in stereotyped, high-pitched
tones as she pressed the spring. &ldquo;You duck!&rdquo;
she added a trifle more enthusiastically, viewing the
bowknot of gems in the form of a pin&ndash;&ndash;a design of
diamonds four inches wide with a centre stone of
pigeon&rsquo;s-blood ruby. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have pleased
me more&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;trying it against her dressing gown.
&ldquo;See, Jody, isn&rsquo;t this wonderful? I must kiss you.&rdquo;
She rustled over to her father and brushed her lips
across his cheek, rustling back again to tell Jody that
she must try the neck coil again&ndash;&ndash;it was entirely too
loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Steve can&rsquo;t go any better than that,&rdquo; her
father said, balancing himself on his toes and, in so
doing, rumpling the rug.</p>
<p>He was a tall, heavily built man with harsh
features and gray hair, the numerous signs of a self-made
man who is satisfied with his own achievements.
He had often told his sister: &ldquo;Bea can be the lady
of the family. I&rsquo;m willing to set back and pay for it.
It&rsquo;d never do for me to start buying antiques or
quoting poetry. I can wear a dress suit without
disgracing Bea, and make an after-dinner speech if
they let me talk about the stockyards. But when it
comes to musicals and monocles I ask to be counted
out. I had to work too hard the first half of my life
to be able to play the last half of it. I wasn&rsquo;t born
in cold storage and baptized with cracked ice the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
these rich men&rsquo;s sons are. I&rsquo;ve shown this city that a
farmer&rsquo;s boy can own the best in the layout and have
his girl be the most gorgeous of the crew&ndash;&ndash;barring
none!</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a joy,&rdquo; Beatrice was saying, rapidly, her
small face wrinkled with displeasure.</p>
<p>She wished her father would go away because she
wanted to think of a hundred details of the next forty-eight
hours and her nerves were giving warning that
their limit of endurance was near at hand. This big,
awkward man who was so harsh a task-master to the
world and so abject a slave to her own useless little
self annoyed her. He offended in an even deeper
sense&ndash;&ndash;he did not interest her. Things which did
not interest her were met with grave displeasure.
Religion did not interest her; neither did Steve
O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s business&ndash;&ndash;her head ached whenever he
ventured to explain it. She never had to listen to
anything to which she did not wish to listen; the only
rule imposed upon her was that of becoming the most
gorgeous girl in Hanover, and this rule she had
obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo; he asked, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead. It&rsquo;s terrible, papa. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll
stay bucked up. I want to burst out crying every time
a bell rings or any one speaks to me.... Oh, Jody,
your fingers are all thumbs! Please try it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks nice,&rdquo; her father ventured, indicating
the puff of gold hair.</p>
<p>Beatrice did not answer; she sighed and had Johanna
proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Harkin detectives will watch the presents,&rdquo;
her father ventured again. &ldquo;There are some more
packages downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of presents; I want to be through unwrapping
crystal vases and gold-lined fruit dishes and
silly book ends and having to write notes of thanks
when I hate the gifts. My mind seems quivering
little wires that won&rsquo;t let me have a moment&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;
She took another piece of candy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I married your mother,&rdquo; her father remarked,
softly, evidently forgetting Johanna&rsquo;s presence,
&ldquo;we walked to a minister&rsquo;s house in Gardenville
about five miles south of here. Your mother was
working for a farmer&rsquo;s wife and she didn&rsquo;t say she was
going to be married. She was afraid they might try
talking her out of it&ndash;&ndash;you know how women do.&rdquo;
He looked round the elegant little room. &ldquo;I was
getting ten dollars a week&ndash;&ndash;that seemed big money
in those days. I rented two rooms in the rear cottage
of a house on Ontario Street&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s torn down now.
And I bought some second-hand stuff to furnish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paced up and down; he had a habit of so doing
since he was always whisked about in his motor car
and he feared growing stiff if he did not exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your mother liked the rooms&ndash;&ndash;and the things.
I remember I bought a combination chair and stepladder
for a dollar and it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo; He gave a
chuckle. &ldquo;It stayed in a sort of betwixt and between
position, about one third stepladder and about two
thirds chair, and that worried me a lot. A dollar
meant a good deal then. But your mother knew
what to do with it, she used it for kindling wood and
said we&rsquo;d charge it up to experience. Yes, sir, we
walked to the minister&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;she wore a blue-print dress
with a little pink sprig in it, and a sort of a bonnet.&rdquo;
His hand made an awkward descriptive gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister was mighty nice&ndash;&ndash;he took us into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
garden and let your mother pick a bunch of roses, and
then he hitched up his horse and buggy and drove us
back to the farmer&rsquo;s house. The farmer&rsquo;s wife cried
a little when we told her; she liked your mother.
She gave us a crock of butter and some jam. While
your mother packed her little trunk&ndash;&ndash;it wasn&rsquo;t any
bigger than one of your hatboxes&ndash;&ndash;I went out and
stood at the gate. I kept thinking, &lsquo;By jingo, I&rsquo;m a
married man! Mr. and Mrs. Mark Constantine.&rsquo;
And I felt sort of afraid&ndash;&ndash;and almost ashamed. It
frightened me because I knew it was two to feed instead
of one, and I wondered if I&rsquo;d done wrong to take
Hannah away from the farmer&rsquo;s wife when I was only
getting ten dollars a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when she came out of the door she looked
as pretty as you&rsquo;ll look in all your stuff, and she came
right up to me and said, game as a pebble, &lsquo;Mark,
we&rsquo;re man and wife and we&rsquo;ll never be sorry, will we?
And when you&rsquo;re rich and I&rsquo;m old we will stay just as
loving!&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t feel sorry or frightened any more&ndash;&ndash;not
once. Not until you came and they told me
she had gone on. Then I felt mighty sorry&ndash;&ndash;and
frightened. She looked so tired when I saw her
then&ndash;&ndash;so tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, staring at his sunken gardens as seen
from Beatrice&rsquo;s windows. Some men lazily raked
new-cut grass and a peacock preened itself by the
sundial. The glass conservatory showed signs of
activity. The florists were at work for the coming
event. Then he looked at his daughter, who waited
with polite restraint until his reverie was ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you all she would have had,&rdquo; he said,
as if in debate with himself that this was the last rebuttal
against possible criticism.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>Beatrice glided over beside him; she looked out of
the window, too, and then at her father. Something
quite like tears was in his harsh eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo; she began with a quick indrawing of her
breath, &ldquo;do you think she&rsquo;d have wanted me to have
all&ndash;&ndash;all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he answered, taking her arm
gently. He had always treated her with a formality
amounting almost to awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;only I sometimes do almost
think&ndash;&ndash;would you suspect it? When I go to the
office and watch those queerly dressed women bending
over desks and earning a few dollars a week and
having to live on it&ndash;&ndash;and when I see how they manage
to smile in spite of it&ndash;&ndash;and how I waste and
spend&ndash;&ndash;and shed a great many tears&ndash;&ndash;well, I wonder
if it is quite safe to start as Steve and I are starting!&rdquo;
Then she threw her arms round him. &ldquo;Steve won&rsquo;t
believe that I&rsquo;ve been serious, will he? Now, daddy
dear, please go &rsquo;way and let me dress, for I&rsquo;m &rsquo;way
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed him almost patronizingly and he tiptoed
out of her room, rather glad to get into his own domain&ndash;&ndash;the
majestic library with its partially arranged
wedding gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing ourselves proud,&rdquo; he remarked to
his sister, who had been rearranging them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I told Beatrice this morning. Only she is
all nerves. She can&rsquo;t enjoy anything&ndash;&ndash;it will be a
relief to me, Mark, as well as a loss, when it is
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother viewed her with a quizzical expression.
Like the rest of the world his sister never fooled him.
But like all supermen there was one human being in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
whom all his trust was centred, and who very often
thus brought about his defeat. In his case, as with
Steve O&rsquo;Valley, it chanced to be Beatrice.</p>
<p>Regarding her both men&ndash;&ndash;merciless with their
associates and dubbed as fish-blooded coroners by
their enemies&ndash;&ndash;were like gullible children following a
lovely and willful Pied Piperess. But Mark&rsquo;s sister
with her vanities and fibs irritated and amused him by
turns. Perhaps he resented her sharing this material
triumph instead of the tired-faced woman in the
churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the time you did the beadwork
for the head carpenter&rsquo;s wife and when she paid you
for it you spent the dollar for liquid rouge? Todd
was so mad he wouldn&rsquo;t speak for a week,&rdquo; he
chuckled, unkindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such things! Think how it would
embarrass Bea. Of course I don&rsquo;t remember.
Neither do you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t I? What&rsquo;s the harm recalling old
times? I remember when you tried to make Todd a
winter overcoat and he said it looked most as good as
a deep-sea diver&rsquo;s outfit. My Hannah nearly died
a-laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately Steve appeared, flourishing Beatrice&rsquo;s
corsage by way of a greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha, the conquerer comes. My dear lad, your
lady love has just ousted me from her room, she&rsquo;ll be
down presently. Belle, Steve and I are going into
the den to smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to look as amiable as possible, but I
wish fuss and feathers were not the mode.&rdquo; Steve
smiled his sweetest at Aunt Belle and then took
Constantine&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;The cave-man style of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
clubbing one&rsquo;s chosen into unconsciousness and strolling
at leisure through the jungle with her wasn&rsquo;t half bad.
By the way, I did sell the Allandale man to-day, and
the razor-factory stock is going to boom instead of
flatten out&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and threw himself into an easy-chair.
Constantine selected a cigar and trimmed its
end, watching Steve as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come on about as well as they ever do,&rdquo;
he remarked, unexpectedly. &ldquo;None of these rich
young dogs could have matched you. Seen the
presents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scads of &rsquo;em. Awful stuff. I don&rsquo;t know what
half of it is for. Bea is going to hand you most of it.
The apartment is to be a thing of beauty and she
won&rsquo;t hear of taking the offerings along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is the shop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid&ndash;&ndash;Mary Faithful will manage it quite as
well as I do. I shall hear from her daily, you&rsquo;ll stroll
over that way, and I can manage to keep my left little
finger on the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s a good sort,&rdquo; Constantine mused. &ldquo;Sorry
I ever let her go over to your shebang. What&rsquo;s her
family like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Never thought about &rsquo;em. Her
kid brother works round the place after school.
Guess Mary&rsquo;s the man of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you pay her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheap enough. A man would draw down
seventy and demand an assistant. I never had any
luck with women secretaries&ndash;&ndash;they all wanted to
marry me,&rdquo; he admitted, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s not that sort. Business is her life. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
she were a man I&rsquo;d have a rival. I&rsquo;m going to give
her fifty a week from now on; she&rsquo;s giving up her
vacation to stay on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger. I&rsquo;ve promised Beatrice to really
learn to play bridge,&rdquo; he changed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accept my sympathy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Constantine began
and then Beatrice in a lovely Bohemian rainbow
dinner gown came stealing in to stand before them
and complain of her headache and admire her corsage
and let Steve wrap her in her cape and half carry her
to the limousine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t see you a moment until we&rsquo;re married,&rdquo;
he began, mournfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been most awfully
neglected. But as you are going to be all mine
I can&rsquo;t complain. You&rsquo;re prettier than ever,
Bea.... Love me?... Lots?...
Whole lots? You don&rsquo;t say it the way I want you
to,&rdquo; laughing at his own nonsense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scream it and a crowd can gather to bear
witness.&rdquo; She dimpled prettily and nibbled at a
rose leaf. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all like a fairy tale&ndash;&ndash;everyone says
so, and lots of the girls would like to be marrying you
on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them I belong to the Gorgeous Girl until six
men are walking quietly beside me and assisting me
to a permanent resting place. Even then I&rsquo;ll belong
to her,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your nose is so handsome,&rdquo; she said, wistfully,
recalling her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking of noses! Bea, sometimes it&rsquo;s terrible to
realize that my ambitions have become true. To
dream and work without ceasing and without much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
caring what you do until your dream merges into
reality&ndash;&ndash;it makes even a six-footer as hysterical as a
schoolgirl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re intense,&rdquo; she said, soberly. &ldquo;Jill says
you&rsquo;d make a wonderful actor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked annoyed. &ldquo;Those scatterbrained
time wasters&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t listen to them. Let&rsquo;s find our
real selves&ndash;&ndash;you and I; be worth while. Now that
I&rsquo;ve made my fortune I want to spend it in a right
fashion&ndash;&ndash;I want to be interested in things, not just
dollars and cents. Help me, dearest. You know
about such things; you&rsquo;ve never had the ugliness of
poverty bruise the very soul of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean having a good time&ndash;&ndash;and parties&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; books, music; studying human conditions.
I want to study the slow healing of industrial wounds
and determine the best treatment for them. I have
made the real me go &rsquo;way, &rsquo;way off somewheres for a
long time until I won my pile of gold that helped me
capture the girl I loved. Now it is done the real me
wants to come back and stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; she said, vaguely. &ldquo;Of course there
are tiny things to brush up on&ndash;&ndash;greeting people, and
you mustn&rsquo;t be so in earnest at dinner parties and
contradict and thump your fist. It isn&rsquo;t good
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When whippersnappers like Gaylord Vondeplosshe&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! Gay&rsquo;s a dear. He is accepted every
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re nearly there, tough luck! One kiss,
please; no one can see. Say you care, then everything
else must true up.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>The wedding took place at high noon in church,
with the bishop and two curates to officiate. There
was a vested choir singing &ldquo;The Voice That Breathed
O&rsquo;er Eden&rdquo;; a thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of flowers; six
bridesmaids in pastel frocks and picture hats,
shepherdess&rsquo; staffs, and baskets of lilies of the valley;
a matron of honour, flower girls, ushers; a best man, a
papa, an aunty in black satin with a large section of
an ostrich farm for her hat&ndash;&ndash;and a bridegroom.</p>
<p>After the wedding came the breakfast at the
Constantine house. Though certain guests murmured
that it was a trifle too ultra like the house itself,
which was half a medieval castle and half the
makings of a village fire department, it was generally
considered a success. Nothing was left undone. The
bride left the church amid the ringing of chimes;
her health was drunk, and she slipped up to the rose-taffeta-adorned
boudoir to exchange her ivory satin
for a trim suit of emerald green. Everyone wished
on the platinum circlet of diamonds and there was the
conventional throwing of the bouquet, the rush
through the back of the grounds to the hired taxi,
the screams of disappointment at the escape&ndash;&ndash;and
Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley were en route on their honeymoon.</p>
<p>It remained for the detectives to guard the presents,
the society reporters to discover new adjectives of
superlative praise, and the guests to drink up the
champagne and say: &ldquo;Wonderful.&rdquo; &ldquo;Must have
cost thousands.&rdquo; &ldquo;Handsome couple. Couldn&rsquo;t
have happened in any other country but America.&rdquo;
&ldquo;War fortune.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, no doubt of it&ndash;&ndash;hides
and razors turned the trick.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, how long do
you think it is going to last?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>The office forces of the O&rsquo;Valley and Constantine
companies had been excused so as to be present at the
ceremony. But Mary Faithful and Trudy Burrows
had not availed themselves of the opportunity.
Womanly rebellion and heartache suddenly blotted
out Mary&rsquo;s emotionless scheme of action. Besides,
there was a valid excuse of waiting to catch an important
long-distance call. With Trudy it was mere
envy causing her to say over and over: &ldquo;See Gay, the
ragged little beggar, walk up the aisle with one of
those rich girls and never glance at me&ndash;&ndash;just because
he&rsquo;s a Vondeplosshe? And me have to sit beside
Nellie Lunk, who&rsquo;ll cry when the organ plays and
wear that ridiculous bathtub of a hat? Never! I
won&rsquo;t go unless I can walk up the aisle with Gay.
Wait until I see him to-night; I&rsquo;ll make it very
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life seemed rather empty for Trudy as she sat in
the deserted offices pretending to add figures and
trying to hum gayly. Even the box of wedding cake
laid on her desk&ndash;&ndash;it was laid on everyone&rsquo;s desk&ndash;&ndash;brought
forth no smile or intention of dreaming over
it. Was she to spend her days earning fifteen dollars
a week in this feudal baron&rsquo;s employ? Tears marred
the intensive cultivation on her rouged cheeks as she
looked out the window to see the office force being
brought back from the church in trucks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like cattle&ndash;&ndash;peasants&ndash;&ndash;all because of money.
A war profiteer, that&rsquo;s what he was. And she isn&rsquo;t
anything at all except that she has her father&rsquo;s
money.&rdquo; She glanced toward Mary&rsquo;s closed door.
&ldquo;Poor Mary,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;she cares! I don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;that
makes it easier. Well, he could have done
worse than to take Mary,&rdquo; tossing her head as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
tried to create the impression of indifference now that
the employees were coming back to their desks.</p>
<p>For there was a forked road for Trudy as well as for
Mary Faithful. Women are no longer compelled to
accept the one unending pathway of domesticity.
Trudy&rsquo;s forked road resolved itself into either marriage
with Gay as a stepping stone to marriage with
someone else, or a smart shop with society women and
actresses as patrons, being able to live at a hotel and
do as she wished, inventing a neat little past of escaping
from a Turkish harem or being the widow of
an English officer who died serving his country.
Trudy was not without resources, in her own estimation,
and whether she married Gay or achieved the
shop was a toss-up. Like the rest of the world she
considered herself capable of doing both!</p>
<p>Hearing the scuffle of feet Mary opened the door
and forced herself to ask about the wedding. Presently
the excitement died down and the round of
mechanical drudgery took its place. An hour later
someone knocked at an inner door which led to steep
side stairs connecting with a side street entrance.
Wondering who it was Mary opened it, to find Steve,
very flushed and handsome, a flower in his buttonhole
yet no hint of rice about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h! Not a word out loud! I want to escape.
Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley is waiting round the corner in a cab. I
forgot the long-distance call&ndash;&ndash;the one we expected
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came while everyone was at the church. I
stayed here in case it did. They will pay your price,
so I closed the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Mary Faithful! But I wish you could
have been there. It was like a picture. I never saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
her look so lovely. Well, that&rsquo;s settled. Wire me at
Chicago. I think that&rsquo;s everything. Oh, you&rsquo;re to
have fifty a week from now on. What man isn&rsquo;t
generous on his wedding day? Good-bye, Miss Head
of Affairs.&rdquo; A moment later he was climbing down
the rickety flight of stairs.</p>
<p>For a long time Mary sat watching the hands of
her desk clock slowly proceed round the dial. Someone
knocked at the door and she said to come in, but
her voice sounded faint and far away.</p>
<p>Fifty dollars a week&ndash;&ndash;generous on his wedding
day! She ought to be very glad; it meant she could
save more and have an occasional treat for Luke. It
was good to think that women had forked roads these
days. How terrible if she were left in the shelter of a
home to mourn unchecked. Besides, she was guarding
his business; that was a great comfort. The
Gorgeous Girl was sharing him with Mary Faithful&ndash;&ndash;would
always share him. That was a comfort, too.</p>
<p>After the errand boy left, Mary tried to write a
letter but she found herself going into the washroom
off Steve&rsquo;s office and without warning weakly burying
her face in an old working coat he had left behind.
She had just made a great many dollars for him
which he would spend on the Gorgeous Girl; she
would make many more during the long summer
while she stayed at the post and was Miss Head of
Affairs. She had laid her woman&rsquo;s hopes on the
altar of commerce because of Steve O&rsquo;Valley, and he
rewarded her with a ten-dollar-a-week raise since a
man was always generous on his wedding day.</p>
<p>Yet there was a distinct satisfaction in the heartache
and the responsibility, even in the irony of the
ten-dollar-a-week advance. Life might be hard&ndash;&ndash;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
it was not empty! She was glad to be in the
deserted office replete with his belongings and
breathing of his personality. She was glad to be an
acknowledged Miss Head of Affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d miss even a heartache if it was all you had,&rdquo;
she whispered to herself from within the folds of
Steve&rsquo;s office coat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>During the summer the O&rsquo;Valley Leather
Company discovered that Mary Faithful
made quite as efficient a manager as Steve
O&rsquo;Valley himself. Nor did she neglect any of a
multitude of petty details&ndash;&ndash;such as the amount of
ice needed for the water cooler, the judicious issue
of office supplies; the innovation of a rest-room for
girls metamorphosed out of a hitherto dingy storeroom;
the eradication of friction between two ancient
bookkeepers who had come to regard the universe
as against them. Even the janitor&rsquo;s feelings were
appeased by a few kind words and a crossing of his
palm with silver when Mary decided to houseclean
before Steve&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>It is impossible for a business woman not to have
feminine notions. They stray into her routine existence
like blades of pale grass persistently shooting
up between the cracks of paving blocks. Quite frilly
curtains adorned Mary&rsquo;s office windows, fresh flowers
were kept in a fragile vase, a marble bust of Dante
guarded the filing cabinet, and despite the general
cleaning she used a special little silk duster for her
own knicknacks. On a table was a very simple
tea service with a brass samovar for days when the
luncheon hour proved too stormy for an outside
excursion.</p>
<p>Sharing Steve with the Gorgeous Girl, Mary had
decided to clean his business home just as the Gorgeous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Girl would have the apartment set in spick-and-span
order. It was during the general upsetting
with brooms, mops, paint pots, and what not, while
Mary good-naturedly tried to work at a standing
desk, that Mark Constantine dropped in unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he began, characteristically. &ldquo;Thought
I&rsquo;d find you in your cool and hospitable office inviting
me to have a siesta.&rdquo; He mopped his face with a
huge silk handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try it in a few days and we will be quite shipshape.&rdquo;
Mary wheeled up a chair for him. &ldquo;Anything
I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank down with relief; his fast-accumulating
flesh made him awkward and fond of lopping down
at unexpected intervals. He glanced up at this amazing
young woman, crisp and cool in her blue muslin
dress, the tiny gold watch in a black silk guard being
her only ornament. His brows drew into what appeared
to be a forbidding frown; he really liked
Mary, with her steady eyes somehow suggesting
eternity and her funny freckled nose destroying any
such notion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on?&rdquo; was all he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendidly. We expect Mr. O&rsquo;Valley a week
from Monday&ndash;&ndash;but of course you know that yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; Constantine repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is Mr. Constantine?&rdquo; Mary asked,
almost graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the hands of my enemy,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Bea
left a hundred and one things to be seen to. My
sister has sprained her ankle and is out of the running.
It&rsquo;s the apartment that causes the trouble&ndash;&ndash;Bea has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
sent letter after letter telling what she wants us to
do. I thought everything was all set before she
went away but&ndash;&ndash;here!&rdquo; He drew out violet notepaper
and handed it over. &ldquo;Sorry to bother you,
but when that girl gets home and settled I hope she&rsquo;ll
be able to tend to her own affairs and leave us in
peace. I guess you understand how women are
about settling a new house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Mary deciphered the slanting, curlicue
handwriting, which said in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, papa dear, I&rsquo;m terribly worried about the painted
Chinese wall panels for the little salon. They are likely to
be the wrong design. Jill has written that hers were. So
please get the man to give you a guarantee that he will
correct any mistakes. I want you to go to Brayton&rsquo;s and
get white-and-gold jars that will look well in the dining
room&ndash;&ndash;Brayton knows my tastes. Besides this, he is to
have two rose pots of old Wheldon ware for me&ndash;&ndash;they will
contain electrically lighted flowers&ndash;&ndash;like old-fashioned
bouquets. I wish you and aunty would drive out to the
arts-and-crafts shop and bid on the red lacquer cabinet
and the French clock that is in stock; I am sure no one
has bought them. I could not decide whether I wanted
them or not until now, and I must have them. They will
tone in beautifully with the rugs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary turned the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, Aunt Belle has not answered my letter asking her
to order the monogrammed stationery&ndash;&ndash;four sizes, please,
ashes of roses shade and lined with gold tissue. I also told
Aunt Belle to see about relining my mink cape and muff.
I shall wish to wear it very early in the season, and I want
something in a smart striped effect with a pleated frill for
the muff. And the little house for Monster completely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
slipped my mind&ndash;&ndash;Aunt Belle knows about it&ndash;&ndash;with a
wind-harp sort of thing at one side and funny pictures
painted on the outside. I have changed my mind about
the colour scheme for the breakfast nook&ndash;&ndash;I am going to
have light gray, almost a silver, and I would like some
good pewter things.</p>
<p>It seems to me I shall never be rested. Steve wants to
see every sunrise and explore every trail. We have met
quite nice people and the dancing at the hotels is lovely.
Oh, yes, if you need any help I know Miss Faithful will be
glad to help, and Gaylord has ripping ideas.</p>
<p>Loads of love to you, dear papa. Your own</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Bea</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary returned the letter without comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you help me?&rdquo; Constantine demanded almost
piteously. &ldquo;Belle&rsquo;s out of the running, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cleaning my own house,&rdquo; Mary began, looking
at the surrounding disorder, &ldquo;but I can run up
to the apartment with you and see what must be
done; though it seems to me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to you what, young woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;that your daughter would prefer to do these
at her leisure&ndash;&ndash;they are so personal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constantine moved uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;I
guess women don&rsquo;t like to do things these days&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;rather
disgruntled in general&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but she might as
well have asked an African medicine man as to ask
me. What do I know about red lacquered cabinets
and relining fur capes? I just pay for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled. Something about his gruff, merciless
personality had always attracted her. She had sometimes
suspected that the day would come when she
would be sorry for him&ndash;&ndash;just why she did not know.
She had watched him from afar during the period of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
being his assistant bookkeeper, and now, having risen
with the fortunes of Steve O&rsquo;Valley, she faced him on
an almost equal footing&ndash;&ndash;another queer quirk of
American commerce.</p>
<p>She realized that his tense race after wealth had
been in a sense his strange manner of grieving for his
wife. But his absolute concentration along one line
resulted in a lack of wisdom concerning all other
lines. Though he could figure to the fraction of a
dollar how to beat the game, play big-fish-swallow-little-fish
and get away with it, he had no more judgment
as to his daughter&rsquo;s absurd self than Monster,
who had gone on the honeymoon wrapped in a new
silken blanket. You cannot have your cake and
eat it, too, as Mary had decided during her early days
of running errands for nervous modistes who boxed
her ears one moment and gave her a silk remnant
the next. Neither can a man put all his powers of
action into one channel, blinding himself to all else
in the world, and expect to emerge well balanced and
normal in his judgments.</p>
<p>As Mary agreed to help Constantine out of his
d&eacute;bris of French clocks and pewter for the breakfast
room she began to feel sorry for him even if he was a
business pirate&ndash;&ndash;for he had paid an extremely high
price for the privilege of being made a fool of by his
own child.</p>
<p>He escorted her to the limousine and they whirled
up to the apartment house, where in all the gray
stone, iron grille work, hall-boy elegance there now
resided three couples of the Gorgeous Girl type, and
where Bea&rsquo;s apartment awaited her coming, the
former tenants having been forced to vacate in time
to have the place completely redone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ask Gaylord if I had to do it myself,&rdquo;
Constantine said, brushing by the maid who opened
the door. &ldquo;There is a young man we could easily
spare. If he ever gets as good a job as painting spots
on rocking-horses I&rsquo;ll eat my hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was surveying the room. &ldquo;Where&ndash;&ndash;where
do we go to from here?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>Constantine sank into a large chair, shaking his
head. &ldquo;Damned if I know,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Look at
that truck!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;pointing to piles of wedding gifts.</p>
<p>Mary walked the length of the drawing room. It
had black velvet panels and a tan carpet with angora
rugs spread at perilous intervals; there was a
flowered-silk chaise-longue, bright yellow damask
furniture, and an Italian-Renaissance screen before
the marble fireplace.</p>
<p>Opening out of this was a salon&ndash;&ndash;this was where
the Chinese panels were to find a haven&ndash;&ndash;and already
cream-and-gold furniture had been placed at artistic
angles with blue velvet hangings for an abrupt contrast.
There was a multitude of books bound in
dove-coloured ooze; cut glass, crystal, silver candelabra
sprinkled throughout. Men were working on
fluted white satin window drapes, and Mary glanced
toward the dining room to view the antique mahogany
and sparkle of plate. Someone was fitting more
hangings in the den, and a woman was disputing
with her co-worker as to the best place for the goldfish
globe and the co-worker was telling her that Monster&rsquo;s
house was to occupy the room&ndash;&ndash;yes, Monster, the
O&rsquo;Valley dog&ndash;&ndash;a pound and a half, he weighed, and
was subject to pneumonia. Here they began to
laugh, and someone else, knowing of Constantine&rsquo;s
presence, discreetly closed the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Flushing, Mary returned to the drawing room and
standing before Constantine&rsquo;s chair she said swiftly:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot help you, sir. I&rsquo;m not this sort.
I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to please. Besides, it is robbing
your daughter of a great joy&ndash;&ndash;and a wonderful duty,
if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying it&ndash;&ndash;this arranging of her
own home. We have no right to do it for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asked us to do it,&rdquo; spluttered the big man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will have to ask her to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was almost stern. It seemed quite enough
to have to stay at her post all summer, run the business
and houseclean the office for his return, without
being expected to come into the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s realm
and do likewise. In this new atmosphere she began
to feel old and plain, quite impossible! The yellow
damask furniture, the rugs, the silver and gold and
lovely extravagances seemed laughing at her and
suggesting: &ldquo;Go back to your filing cabinet and your
old-maid silk dusting cloths, to your rest-rooms for
girls, and to your arguments with city salesmen. You
have no more right here than she will ever have in
your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Constantine would have argued further she
threw back her head defiantly, saying: &ldquo;Someone explains
the difference between men and women by the
fact that men swear and women scream, which is true
as far as it goes. But in these days you often find
a screaming gentleman and a profane lady&ndash;&ndash;and
there&rsquo;s a howdy-do! You can&rsquo;t ask the profane lady&ndash;&ndash;no
matter if she is a right-hand business man&ndash;&ndash;to
come fix pretties. You better write your daughter
what I&rsquo;ve said, and if you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;d like to get
back to the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constantine rose, frowning down at her with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
expression that would have frightened a good many
women stauncher than Mary Faithful. For she had
mentioned to him what no one, not even his sluggish
conscience, had ever hinted at&ndash;&ndash;his daughter&rsquo;s duty.</p>
<p>But all he said was: &ldquo;Profane ladies and screaming
gentlemen. Well, I&rsquo;ve put a screaming-gentleman
tag on Gaylord Vondeplosshe&ndash;&ndash;but what about yourself?
Where are you attempting to classify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? I&rsquo;ll be damned if I help you out,&rdquo; she
laughed up at him as she moved toward the door.</p>
<p>Chuckling, yet defeated, Constantine admitted
her triumph and sent her back to the office in the
limousine.</p>
<p>At that identical moment Gaylord, alias the screaming
gentleman, had been summoned to Aunt Belle&rsquo;s
bedside. For Beatrice believed in having two strings
to her bow and she had written her aunt a second
deluge of complaints and requests. Bemoaning the
sprained ankle&ndash;&ndash;and the probable regaining of three
pounds which had been laboriously massaged away&ndash;&ndash;Aunt
Belle had called for Gaylord&rsquo;s sympathy and
support.</p>
<p>While Mary, rather perturbed yet unshaken in her
convictions, returned to the office and Constantine
had decided his blood pressure could not stand any
traipsing round after folderols, Gaylord was eagerly
taking notes and saying pretty nothings to the doleful
Mrs. Todd, who relied utterly on his artistic
judgment and promptness of action.</p>
<p>Whereupon Gaylord proudly rolled out of the Constantine
gates in a motor car bearing Constantine&rsquo;s
monogram, and by late afternoon he had come to
a most satisfactory understanding with decorators
and antique dealers&ndash;&ndash;an understanding which led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to an increase in the prices Beatrice was to pay and
the splitting of the profits between one Gaylord
Vondeplosshe and the tradesmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A supper!&rdquo; Mark Constantine demanded crisply
that same evening, merely groaning when his sister
told him that Gaylord had undertaken all the errands
and was such a dear boy. &ldquo;And send it up to my
room&ndash;&ndash;ham, biscuits, pie, and iced coffee, and I&rsquo;m
not at home if the lord mayor calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He departed to the plainest room in the mansion
and turned on an electric fan to keep him company.
He sat watching the lawn men at their work, wondering
what he was to do with this barn of a place. Beatrice
had told him forcibly that she was not going to live
in it. Wherein was the object of keeping it open for
Belle Todd and himself when more and more he
wished for semi-solitude? Noise and crowds and
luxuries irritated him. He liked meals such as the
one he had ordered, the plebeian joy of taking off
tight shoes and putting on disreputable slippers,
sitting in an easy-chair with his feet on another, while
he read detective stories or adventurous romances
with neither sense nor moral. He liked to relive
in dream fashion the years of early endeavour&ndash;&ndash;of
his married life with Hannah. After he finished the
reverie he would tell himself with a flash of honesty,
&ldquo;Gad, it might as well have happened to some other
fellow&ndash;&ndash;for all the good it does you.&rdquo; Nothing
seemed real to Constantine except his check book
and his wife&rsquo;s monument.</p>
<p>It was still to dawn upon him that his daughter
partly despised him. He had always said that no
one loved him but his child, and that no one but his
child mattered so far as he was concerned. Since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Beatrice&rsquo;s marriage he had become restless, wretched,
desperately lonesome; he found himself missing
Steve quite as much as he missed Beatrice. Their
letters were unsatisfactory since they were chiefly
concerned with things&ndash;&ndash;endless things that they
coveted or had bought or wanted in readiness for their
return. As he sat watching the lawn men gossip
he knitted his black brows and wondered if he ought
to sell the mansion and be done with it. Then it
occurred to him that grandchildren playing on the
velvety lawn would make it quite worth while.
With a thrill of anticipation he began to plan for his
grandchildren and to wonder if they, too, would be
eternally concerned with things.</p>
<p>As he recalled Mary&rsquo;s defiance he chuckled. &ldquo;A
ten-dollar-a-week raise was cheap for such a woman,&rdquo;
he thought.</p>
<p>Meantime, Trudy informed the Faithful family
at supper: &ldquo;Gay has telephoned that he is coming
to-night. Were you going to use the parlour,
Mary?&rdquo; A mere formality always observed for no
reason at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going to water the garden. It&rsquo;s as dry
as Sahara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make Luke help you. He&rsquo;s stoop-shouldered
enough from study without making him
carry sprinkling cans,&rdquo; Mrs. Faithful objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It&rsquo;s good for him, and he will be
through in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late for the first movie show,&rdquo; expostulated
Luke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A world tragedy,&rdquo; his sister answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to go to-night,&rdquo; her mother insisted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely story. Mrs. Bowen was in to tell
me about it&ndash;&ndash;all about a Russian war bride. They
built a whole town and burnt it up at the end of the
story. I guess it cost half a million&ndash;&ndash;and there&rsquo;s
fighting in it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go and take Luke. But I don&rsquo;t think
the movies are as good for him as working in a
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never want me to have pleasure. Home all
day with only memories of the dead for company,
and then you come in as cross as a witch, ready to
stick your nose in a book or go dig in the mud! Excuse
me, Trudy, but a body has to speak out sometimes.
Your father to the life&ndash;&ndash;reading and grubbing
with plants. Oh, mother&rsquo;s proud of you,
Mary, but if you would only get yourself up a little
smarter and go out with young people you&rsquo;d soon
enough want Luke to go out, too! I don&rsquo;t pretend
to know what your judgment toward your poor old
mother would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s day had included a dispute with a firm&rsquo;s
London representative, the Constantine incident, a
session at the dentist&rsquo;s as a noon-recess attraction,
housecleaning the office, and two mutually contradictory
wires from Steve. She laid her knife and fork
down with a defiant little clatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t burn the candle at both ends. I work all
day and I have to relax when I leave the office. If
my form of a good time is to read or set out primroses
it is nothing to cry thief for, is it? I want you to go
out, mother, as you very well know. And you are
welcome to fill the house with company. Only if I&rsquo;m
to do a man&rsquo;s work and earn his wage I must claim
my spare time for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen here, dear,&rdquo; interposed Trudy, who
took Mary&rsquo;s part when it came to a real argument,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t get peeved. Let me buy your next dress
and show you how to dance. You&rsquo;ll be surprised
what a difference it will make. You&rsquo;ll get so you
just hate ever to think of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid! Who will pay the butcher, baker, and
candlestick maker?&rdquo; Mary thought of the wedding
presents carelessly stacked about Beatrice&rsquo;s apartment.
One pile of them, as she measured expenses,
would have paid the aforementioned gentlemen for a
year or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got her going,&rdquo; Luke objected. &ldquo;Say,
Trudy, you don&rsquo;t kill yourself tearing off any work
at the shop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke,&rdquo; began his mother, &ldquo;be a gentleman.
Dear me, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t said a word. To think of
my children in business! Why, Luke ought to be
attending a private school and going to little cotillion
parties like my brothers did; and Mary in her
own home.&rdquo; She pressed her napkin to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit Mary carries me along on the pay roll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
Mary&rsquo;s foolishness,&rdquo; Trudy said, easily. &ldquo;Mary&rsquo;s
a good scout even if she does keep us stepping. She
has to fall down once in a while, and she fell hard
when she hired me and took me in as a boarder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary flushed. &ldquo;I try to make you do your share,&rdquo;
she began, &ldquo;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to pay more board,&rdquo; Trudy giggled at her
own audacity. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re too decent
to make me. You know I&rsquo;m such a funny fool I&rsquo;d
go jump in the river if I got blue or things went
wrong, and you like me well enough to not want that.
Don&rsquo;t worry about our Mary, Mrs. Faithful. Just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
let her manage Luke and he won&rsquo;t wander from her
apron strings like he will if you and I keep him in
tow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke made a low bow, scraping his chair back from
the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ahead and get reserved seats and
mother can come when she&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; he proposed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Faithful beamed with triumph. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
my son! Get them far enough back, the pictures
blur if I&rsquo;m too close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the dishes,&rdquo; Mary said, briefly. &ldquo;Go and
get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wipe them only Gay is coming so early,&rdquo;
Trudy explained, glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be alone.&rdquo; Mary was piling up the
pots and pans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, deary, if you don&rsquo;t feel right about mother&rsquo;s
going,&rdquo; her mother resumed a little later as she poked
her head into the kitchen, &ldquo;just say so. But I
certainly want to see that town burnt up; and besides,
it&rsquo;s teaching Luke history. Dear me, your hair is dull.
Why don&rsquo;t you try that stuff Trudy uses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not Trudy. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all nerves again. I&rsquo;d certainly let someone
else do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need a vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you want to get away from us. Well,
I try to keep the home together. Leave that coffeepot
just as it is, I&rsquo;ll want a drop when I get back.&rdquo;
Waddling out the door Mrs. Faithful left Mary to
assault the dishes and long for Steve&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why the great plan did not make it
possible for all folks to like their relatives?&rdquo; she asked
herself as she finally hung the tea towels on the line;
&ldquo;or their star boarder?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>Then she became engrossed in the way the newly
set out plants had taken root. Bending over the
flower beds she was hardly conscious that darkness
had fallen over the earth&ndash;&ndash;a heavenly, summer-cool
darkness with veiled stars prophetic of a blessed
shower. She repaired to the porch swing to dream
her dreams of fluffs and frills, arrange a dream house
and live therein. It should be quite unlike the
Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s apartment&ndash;&ndash;but a roomy, sprawling
affair with old furniture that was used and loved
and shabby, well-read books, carefully chosen pictures,
dull rugs, and oddly shaped lamps, a shaggy
old dog to lie before the open fireplace and be
patted occasionally, fat blue jugs of Ragged Robin
roses at frequent intervals. Perhaps there would
be a baby&rsquo;s toy left somewhere along the stairway
leading to the nursery. When one has the cool of
a summer&rsquo;s night, a porch screened with roses and a
comfortable swing, what does it matter if there
are unlikable persons and china-shop apartment
houses?</p>
<p>Had Mary known what was taking place in the
front parlour it would not have jarred her from her
dreams. For Gaylord, resplendent in ice-cream
flannels, and Trudy, wearing an unpaid-for black-satin
dress with red collar and cuffs, were both busier
than the proverbial beaver planning their wedding.
It was to be an informal and unexpected little affair,
being the direct result of the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s demands
as to settling her household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how jolly easy it was, Babseley.
There was a dressing case I know Bea will keep&ndash;&ndash;it
brought me a cool hundred commission&ndash;&ndash;it had just
come in. I plunged and bought two altar scarfs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
she can use for her reading stand&ndash;&ndash;she likes such
things, besides all the bona-fide orders. I&rsquo;ve been
working for fair&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;ve made over a thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy kissed Bubseley between his pale little eyes.
&ldquo;You Lamb! Sure you won&rsquo;t have to give it back
or that they will tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! They&rsquo;d give their own selves
away. That&rsquo;s the way such things are always done,
y&rsquo;know. I&rsquo;ve an idea that I&rsquo;ll go in seriously for the
business by and by. I don&rsquo;t feel any compunction;
I&rsquo;m entitled to every cent of it; in fact, I call it cheap
for Bea at a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will they really pay you?&rdquo; Trudy was skeptical.
It seemed such a prodigious amount for buying
a few trifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Constantine credit is like the Bank of England.
I&rsquo;ll have my money and we&rsquo;ll make our getaway
before Bea arrives in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Trudy did not approve of this. The contrast
between her marriage and the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s
wedding rankled.</p>
<p>Gay hesitated. &ldquo;I want to go to New York and
see concert managers and father&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; he evaded.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll visit my sister in Connecticut as long
as she&rsquo;ll have us. And when we come back&ndash;&ndash;well,
you&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll know the smart ways better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a trifle afraid of Trudy and he did not know
how best to advise her that her slips in speech and
manners would be more easily remedied by setting
her an example of the correct thing than by staying
in Hanover and leading a cat-and-dog life, getting
nowhere at all.</p>
<p>Trudy kissed him again. &ldquo;Hurrah for the eternal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
frolic!&rdquo; she said, adding: &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll know Beatrice
and Steve socially, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he said, in helpless concession.</p>
<p>His one-cylinder little brain had not yet reckoned
with Trudy&rsquo;s determination to conquer the social
arena. He knew he must have her to help him; his
efforts with creditors were failing sadly of late. Besides,
he admired her tremendously; he felt like a rake
and a deuce of a chap when they went out together,
and he relied on her vivacity&ndash;&ndash;Pep had been his pet
name for her before he originated Babseley&ndash;&ndash;to carry
him through. It really would be quite an easy matter
to live on nothing a year until something turned up.
The graft from Beatrice was the open sesame, however,
and the Gorgeous Girl would never suspect the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep right on working hard,&rdquo; Trudy said, fondly,
as they kissed each other good-night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mary
to-morrow. I want to leave my big trunk here because
we might want to stay here for a few days when
we come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;masterfully pointing his cane at the
moon. &ldquo;My wife is going to have her own apartment.
One of father&rsquo;s friends has built several
apartment houses and he&rsquo;ll be sure to let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we dreaming?&rdquo; Trudy asked, thinking of
how indebted she was to Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley, yet how
she envied and hated her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Babseley, I&rsquo;ll phone you to-morrow and come
down. If you see me flying about in a machine don&rsquo;t
be surprised; I&rsquo;m to use their big car as much as I like.
But it would be a little thick to have us seen together&ndash;&ndash;just
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that the whole social set gets a draft from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
me that will open their eyes,&rdquo; Trudy promised, loath
to have him go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If old man Constantine knew I drew that money
down!&rdquo; Gay chuckled with delight. &ldquo;When his
favourite after-dinner story is to tell how Steve
O&rsquo;Valley lay on his stomach and watched goats for
an education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have my finger between his teeth when
he learns the truth,&rdquo; Trudy prompted.</p>
<p>She spent half the night taking inventory of her
wardrobe, her debts, and her personal charms, practising
airs and graces before her mirror and calculating
how long the thousand would last them. All the
world was before her, to Trudy&rsquo;s way of thinking.
She would be Mrs. Gaylord Vondeplosshe, and with
Gay&rsquo;s name and her brain&ndash;&ndash;well, to give Trudy&rsquo;s
own sentiments, they would soon be able to carry
the whole show in their grip and use the baggage
cars to bring back the profits!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Gaylord&rsquo;s sudden marriage and departure
for New York caused no small comment. In
the Faithful family Mary and Luke stood
against Mrs. Faithful, who declared with meaning
emphasis that some girls had more sense than others
and it was better to marry and make a mistake the
first time than to remain an old maid. With Trudy&rsquo;s
style and high spirits she was going to carry Gaylord
into the front ranks without any effort. Luke described
the event by saying that a bad pair of disturbers
had teamed for life, and relied upon Mary
to take up the burden of the proof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mourn so, mother. I&rsquo;m a happy old
maid,&rdquo; she insisted when the comments grew too
numerous for her peace of mind. &ldquo;Trudy was not
the sort to blush unseen, and it&rsquo;s a relief not to have
to cover up her mistakes at the office. Everything
will be serene once more. As for Gay&rsquo;s future&ndash;&ndash;I
suppose he is likely to bring home anything from
a mousetrap to a diamond tiara. I don&rsquo;t pretend to
understand his ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t like Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s wedding,&rdquo;
her mother resumed, with a resonant sniffle. &ldquo;You
have been so used to hearing about her ways that poor
little Trudy seems cheap. Perhaps your mother
and brother and the little home seem so, too. But we
can&rsquo;t all be Gorgeous Girls, and I think Trudy was
right to take Gaylord when he had the money for a
ring and a license.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He had more than that,&rdquo; Mary ruminated.
&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t walk to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he win it on a horse race?&rdquo; Luke had an eye
to the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe his father&rsquo;s friends helped him,&rdquo; Mrs.
Faithful added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t prove anything by me.&rdquo; Mary shook her
head.</p>
<p>Neither Trudy nor Gaylord knew that all Beatrice&rsquo;s
bills were sent to Mary to discount, and Mary,
not without a certain shrewdness, had her own ideas
on the matter. But it amused more than it annoyed
her. Gay might as well have a few hundred to spend
in getting a wife and caretaker as tradesmen whose
weakness it was to swell their profits beyond all respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where they will live.&rdquo; Mrs. Faithful
found the subject entirely too fascinating to let alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; her daughter assured her. &ldquo;And
if you&rsquo;d only say yes I could get such a sunny, pretty
flat where the work would be worlds easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave my home? Never! It would be like
uprooting an oak forest. Time for that when I am
dead and gone.&rdquo; The double chin quivered with
indignation. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Trudy and Gay won&rsquo;t
come here and take the two front rooms. They&rsquo;d
be company for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She approved of Trudy&rsquo;s views of life as much as
she disapproved and was rather afraid of this young
woman who wanted to bustle her into trim house
dresses instead of the eternal wrappers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept Trudy only because she needed work&ndash;&ndash;and
a home,&rdquo; Mary said, frankly; &ldquo;and because you wanted
her. But my salary does nicely for us. Besides, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
would be a bad influence for Luke to have such a person
as Gay about. We must make a man out of Luke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go upsetting him. He eats his three good
meals a day and always acts like a little gentleman.
You&rsquo;ll nag at him until he runs away like my brother
Amos did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better run away from us than run over us,&rdquo;
Mary argued; &ldquo;but there is no need of planning for
Trudy&rsquo;s return. Their home will be in a good part
of the city, if it consists in merely hanging onto a
lamp-post. You don&rsquo;t realize that Gay is a bankrupt
snob and married Trudy only because he could play
off cad behind his pretty wife&rsquo;s skirts. Men will
like Trudy and the women ridicule and snub her until
she finds she has a real use for her claws. Up to now
she has only halfway kept them sharpened. In a
few years you will find Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord Vondeplosshe
in Hanover society with capital letters,
hobnobbing with Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley and her set and
somehow managing to exist in elegance. Don&rsquo;t ask
how they will do it&ndash;&ndash;but they will. However, they
would never consider starting from our house. That
would be getting off on a sprained ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Faithful gulped the rest of her coffee. &ldquo;No
one has any use for me because I haven&rsquo;t money. Our
parlour was good enough for them to do their courting
in, and if they don&rsquo;t come and see me real often I&rsquo;ll
write Trudy a letter and tell her some good plain
facts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to say we all think Gay&rsquo;s mother must
have been awful fond of children to have raised
him,&rdquo; Luke suggested from the offing.</p>
<p>Mary tossed a sofa pillow at him and disappeared.
She could have electrified her mother by telling her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
that Steve was to return that morning, that the office
was prepared to welcome him back, and that Mrs.
O&rsquo;Valley would be anchored at the telephone to get
into communication with her dearest and best of
friends.</p>
<p>As she walked to the street car she reproached
herself for not having told the news. It was a tiny
thing to tell a woman whose horizon was bounded
by coffee pots, spotted wrappers, and inane movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mean in spots,&rdquo; Mary told herself. &ldquo;You
know how it would have pleased her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sometimes felt a maternal compassion for
this helpless dear with her double chins and self-sacrificing
past, and she wondered whether her father
had not had the same attitude during the years of
nagging reproach at his lack of material prosperity.
She resolved to come home that night with a budget
of news items concerning Steve&rsquo;s return, even bringing
a rose from the floral offering that was to be
placed on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, she&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; Mary thought, rounding
the corner leading to the office building, &ldquo;and like
most of us she does the best she can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to maintain a calm demeanour in the office
as she answered inquiries and opened the mail. But
all the time she kept glancing at her desk clock. Half-past
nine&ndash;&ndash;of course he would be late&ndash;&ndash;surely he
must come by ten. She wished she had flung maidenly
discretion to the winds and worn the white silk
sport blouse she had just bought. But she had made
herself dress in a crumpled waist of nondescript
type. The floral piece on Steve&rsquo;s long-deserted
desk made her keep glancing up to smile at its almost
funeral magnificence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>She answered a telephone call. Yes, Mr. O&rsquo;Valley
was expected&ndash;&ndash;undoubtedly he would wish to reserve
a plate for the Chamber of Commerce luncheon&ndash;&ndash;unless
they heard to the contrary they could do so.
... Oh, it was to include the wives and so on.
Then reserve places for Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley. She
hung up the receiver abruptly and went to making
memoranda.</p>
<p>Even if she demanded and would receive a share
of Steve&rsquo;s time and attention it would be the thankless,
almost bitter portion&ndash;&ndash;such as reserving plates
for Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley or O.K.ing Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s
bills. Still it was hers, awarded to her because of
keenness of brain and faithfulness of action. Steve
needed her as much as he needed to come home to his
miniature palace to watch the Gorgeous Girl display
her latest creation, to be able to take the Gorgeous
Girl fast in his arms and say: &ldquo;You are mine&ndash;&ndash;mine&ndash;&ndash;mine!&rdquo;
very likely punctuating the words with
kisses. Yet he must return each day to Mary
Faithful and say: &ldquo;You are my right-hand man; I
need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts.&rdquo; Steve O&rsquo;Valley
was standing beside her. &ldquo;You look as if work
agreed with you. Say something nice now&ndash;&ndash;that a
long holiday has improved me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She managed to put a shaking hand into his,
wondering if she betrayed her thoughts. Being
as tall as Steve she was able to look at him, not up
at him; and there they stood&ndash;&ndash;the handsome, reckless
man with just a suggestion of nervous tension in his
Irish blue eyes, and the plain young woman in a
rumpled linen blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;so I don&rsquo;t please,&rdquo; he bantered. &ldquo;Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
tell us all about it. I&rsquo;ve a thousand questions&ndash;&ndash;my
father-in-law says you are the only thing I have that
he covets. How about that?&rdquo; He led the way into
his office, Mary following.</p>
<p>Then he fell upon his mountain of mail and memoranda,
demands for this charity and that patriotic
subscription, and Mary began a careful explanation
of affairs and they sat talking and arguing until
the general superintendent looked in to suggest
that the shop might like to have Mr. O&rsquo;Valley say
hello.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly eleven,&rdquo; Steve exclaimed, &ldquo;and we
haven&rsquo;t begun to say a tenth of all there is to discuss.
See the funeral piece, Hodges? Why didn&rsquo;t you
label it &lsquo;Rest in pieces&rsquo; and be done with it, eh? I
shall now appear to make a formal speech.&rdquo; Here
he cut a rosebud from the big wreath and handed it
gravely to Mary; he cut a second one and fastened
it in his own buttonhole. &ldquo;Lead me out, Hodges.
I&rsquo;m a bit unsteady&ndash;&ndash;been playing too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary stood in the doorway, one hand caressing
the little rose. That Beatrice should have had the
flower was her first thought. Then it occurred to her
that Beatrice would have all the flowers at the formal
affairs to be given the bridal couple, besides sitting
opposite Steve at his own table. She no longer felt
that she had stolen the rose or usurped attention.
There was a clapping of hands and the usual laughter
which accompanies listening to any generous proprietor&rsquo;s
speech, a trifle forced perhaps but very jolly
sounding. Then Steve returned to his office to become
engrossed in conversation with Mary until
Mark Constantine dropped in to bowl him off to the
club for luncheon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s kept things humming, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Constantine
asked, sinking into the nearest chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prize,&rdquo; Steve said, proudly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find a
slip-up any place. I&rsquo;ll be back at two, Miss Faithful,
in case any one calls.... How is Bea?&rdquo; His
voice softened noticeably.</p>
<p>Mary slipped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bea doesn&rsquo;t like one half of her things and the
other half are so much better than the apartment
that she says they don&rsquo;t show up,&rdquo; her father admitted,
drolly. &ldquo;She is tired to death&ndash;&ndash;so you&rsquo;ll find
her at home, my boy, with a box of candy and the
latest novel. Belle was talking her head off when I
left the house and the girls keep calling her on the
telephone for those little three-quarters-of-an-hour
hello talks. It seems to me that for rich girls, my
daughter and her friends are the busiest, most tired
women I ever knew&ndash;&ndash;and yet do the least.&rdquo; He put
on his hat and waited for Steve to open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand them,&rdquo; Steve
answered. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so happy. Bea
fusses if the shade of draperies doesn&rsquo;t match her
gown, and if Monster has a snarl in her precious hair it
is cause for a tragedy. But I just grin and go along
and presently she has forgotten all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to get that young woman helper of yours
to help me fix up Bea&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; Constantine complained.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk to the club&ndash;&ndash;my knees are
going stiff on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked round the apartment and plain refused
to put away another woman&rsquo;s pots and pans.
It was just spunk. I don&rsquo;t know that I blame her.
So Belle got that low order of animal life&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Gaylord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and now the husband, I understand, of one of
your thinnest clad and thinnest brained former clerks.
Gay was in his element; he kept the machine working
overtime and flattered Belle until he had everything
his own way. Yet Beatrice seems quite satisfied
with his achievements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been hanging round the house this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get down to brass tacks,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had her all summer&ndash;&ndash;but you can bet your
clothes you wouldn&rsquo;t have had her if I hadn&rsquo;t been
willing.&rdquo; He slapped Steve on the shoulder good-naturedly.</p>
<p>Steve nodded briskly. Then he suggested: &ldquo;Bea
has the New York idea rather strong. Has she ever
hinted it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that flourish, Steve. Kill it at the start.
She knew better than to try to wheedle me into going.
I&rsquo;m smarter than most of the men round these parts
but I&rsquo;d be fleeced properly by the New York band
of highbinders if I tried to go among them. And
you&rsquo;re not as good at the game as I am. Not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He paused as if undecided how much would be best
to tell Steve. He evidently decided that generalities
would be the wisest arguments, so he continued:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wince&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the truth, and there must be no
secrets between us from now on. Besides, you&rsquo;re
in love and you can&rsquo;t concentrate absolutely. My
best advice to you is to stay home and tend to your
knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Bea can go play round New York all
you like. Let the New York crowd come to see you
and be entertained, they&rsquo;ll be glad to eat your dinners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and drink your wine if they don&rsquo;t have to pay for it.
We can get away with Hanover but we&rsquo;d be handcuffed
if we tried New York. When I made a hundred
thousand dollars I was tempted to try New York
instead of staying here&ndash;&ndash;to make Bea the most gorgeous
girl in the metropolis. But horse sense made me
pass it by and stay on my own home diamond. So
I&rsquo;ve made a good many more hundreds of thousands
and, what&rsquo;s to the point, I&rsquo;ve kept &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the conversation drifted into more technical
business detail with Steve expostulating and contradicting
and Constantine frowning at his son-in-law
through his bushy eyebrows, admiring him prodigiously
all the while.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Beatrice had telephoned Steve&rsquo;s office, to be told
that her husband was at lunch and would not be in
until two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have him come to our apartment,&rdquo; she left word,
&ldquo;just as soon as he can. I am just leaving Mr. Constantine&rsquo;s
house to go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which she began telling Aunt Belle good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Bea, what a wonderful hat!&rdquo; her aunt
sighed. &ldquo;I never saw anything more becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took ten minutes to admire Bea&rsquo;s costume of
rosewood crape and the jewelled-cap effect, somewhat
like Juliet&rsquo;s, caught over each ear by a pink satin rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve doesn&rsquo;t appreciate anything in the way of
costumes,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;He just says: &lsquo;Yes,
deary, I love you, and anything you wear suits me.&rsquo;
Quite discouraging and so different from the other
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call it very comfortable,&rdquo; suggested her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so&ndash;&ndash;but comfortable things are often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
tiresome. It is tiresome, too, to see too much of the
same person. I was really bored to death in the
Yosemite&ndash;&ndash;Steve is so primitive&ndash;&ndash;he wanted to stay
there for days and days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve comes from primitive people,&rdquo; her aunt
said, soberly, not realizing her own humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. Didn&rsquo;t he force me to go to
Virginia City, the most terrible little ghost world
of tumbledown shacks and funny one-eyed, one-suspendered
men, and old women smoking pipes
and wearing blue sunbonnets! He was actually
sentimental and enthusiastic about it all, trying
to hunt up old cronies of his grandfather&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;I was
cross as could be until we came back to Reno. Now
Reno is interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spent the better part of an hour describing
the divorcees and their adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m off for home. I think I shall entertain
the Red Cross committee first of all. It&rsquo;s only right,
I believe&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the dove eyes very serious&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
been under such terrible strains. I&rsquo;m going to send
a large bundle of clothes for the Armenian Relief, too.
Oh, aunty, the whole world seems under a cloud,
doesn&rsquo;t it? But I met the funniest woman in Pasadena;
she actually teed her golf ball on a valuable
Swiss watch her husband had given her! She said
her only thrills in life came from making her husband
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he&ndash;&ndash;when he found it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she was dreadfully disappointed. He called
her a naughty child and bought her another!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Beatrice reached the apartment she found
Steve standing on the steps looking anxiously up and
down the street.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he asked, half lifting her
out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! People will see us. I was telling aunty
about Reno. Oh, it&rsquo;s so good to be here!&rdquo; as she
came inside her own door. &ldquo;I hope people will let
me alone the rest of the day. I&rsquo;m just a wreck.&rdquo;
She found a box of chocolates and began to eat them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming-looking wreck, I&rsquo;ll say.&rdquo; He stooped
to kiss her.</p>
<p>The rose-coloured glasses were still attached to
Steve&rsquo;s naturally keen eyes. Like many persons he
knew a multitude of facts but was quite ignorant
concerning vital issues. He had spent his honeymoon
in rapt and unreal fashion. He had realized
his boyhood dream of returning to Nevada a rich and
respected man with a fairy-princess sort of wife. The
deadly anaesthesia of unreality which these get-rich-quick
candidates of to-day indulge in at the outset
of their struggle still had Steve in its clutch. He
had not even stirred from out its influence. He had
accomplished what he had set out to accomplish&ndash;&ndash;and
he was now about to realize that there is a distinct
melancholy in the fact that everyone needs an
Aladdin&rsquo;s window to finish. But under the influence
of the an&aelig;sthesia he had proposed to have an
everlasting good time the rest of his life, like the closing
words of a fairy tale: &ldquo;And then the beautiful
young princess and the brave young prince, having
slain the seven-headed monster, lived happily ever,
ever after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this viewpoint, emphasized by the natural
conceit of youth, Steve had passed his holiday with
the Gorgeous Girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want, darling?&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;To talk to you&ndash;&ndash;I want you to listen to my plan.
You are to come with me to New York for the fall
opera and all the theatres&ndash;&ndash;oh, along in November.
It&rsquo;s terribly dull here. Jill Briggs and her husband
and some of the others are going, and we can take
rooms at the Astor and all be together and have a
wonderful time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay in our own home,&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such fun to have a real home. We can entertain,
you know. Besides, I&rsquo;m the worker and you
are the player, and I don&rsquo;t understand your sort of
life any more than you can understand mine. So
you must play and let me look on&ndash;&ndash;and love me,
that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll ever ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; was his reward; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll go to
New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take you down and leave you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
needed at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be the odd one&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d have to have a partner.
Steve, dear, you don&rsquo;t have to grub. When
we were engaged you always had time for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you had so little for me! And so I always
shall have time for you,&rdquo; the an&aelig;sthesia causing
his decision. &ldquo;Besides, those were courtship days&ndash;&ndash;and
I wasn&rsquo;t quite so sure of you, which is the way
of all men.&rdquo; He kissed her hair gently.</p>
<p>She drew away and rearranged a lock. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want a husband who won&rsquo;t play with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it all right, don&rsquo;t worry. Now was that
all you wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to stay home and go driving with me.
I want you to call on some people&ndash;&ndash;and look at a new
cellaret I&rsquo;d like to buy. It is expensive, but no one
else would have one anywhere near as charming. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
need you this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re so calm and strong,
and my head aches. I&rsquo;m always tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you never work,&rdquo; he said, almost unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, society is the hardest work in the
world. I&rsquo;m simply dragged to a frazzle by the end of
the season. Besides, there is all my war work and
my clubs and my charities. And I&rsquo;ve just promised
to take an advanced course in domestic science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Steve said, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is the duty of rich women to know all
about frying things as well as eating them,&rdquo; she said,
as she took a third caramel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true. Having money isn&rsquo;t always keeping
it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa has loads of money&ndash;&ndash;enough for all of
us,&rdquo; she remarked, easily. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that. I&rsquo;d never
cook if I were poor, anyway; that would be the last
thing I&rsquo;d ever dream of doing. It&rsquo;s fun to go to the
domestic-science class as long as all my set go. Well&ndash;&ndash;will
you be a nice angel-man and stay home to amuse
your fractious wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Miss Faithful on the phone and say I&rsquo;m
going to play hooky,&rdquo; he consented. &ldquo;By the way,
you must come down to the office and say hello to her
when you get the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice kissed him. &ldquo;Must I? I hate offices.
Besides, Gaylord has married your prettiest clerk,
and there will be no one to play with me except my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing&ndash;&ndash;that marriage,&rdquo; Steve commented.
&ldquo;If it was any one but Gay I&rsquo;d send condolences for
loading the office nuisance onto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she any use at all?&rdquo; she asked, curiously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;None&ndash;&ndash;always having a headache and being excused
for the day. That was the only thing I ever
questioned in Mary Faithful&ndash;&ndash;why she engaged
Trudy and took her into her own home as a boarder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so Mary isn&rsquo;t perfection? Don&rsquo;t be too
hard on the other girl. I&rsquo;d be quite as useless if I
ever had to work. I&rsquo;d do just the same&ndash;&ndash;have
as many headaches as the firm would stand for, and
marry the first man who asked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of marrying Gay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Gay&ndash;&ndash;his father was a dear, and he is
terribly well behaved. Besides, see how obliging he
is. Your Miss Faithful refused to help me out, and
Gay ran his legs off to get everything I wanted. I&rsquo;ll
never be rude to Gay as long as he amuses me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing that leads them all, isn&rsquo;t it,
princess?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>After the first round of excessively formal
entertainments for Mr. and Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley,
Steve found a mental hunger suddenly asserting
itself. It was as if a farm hand were asked to subsist
upon a diet of weak tea and wafers.</p>
<p>In the first place, no masculine mind can quite admit
the superiority of a feminine mind when it concerns
handling said masculine mind&rsquo;s business affairs.
Though Steve insisted that Mary had done
quite as well as he would have done, he told himself
secretly that he must get down to hard work and go
over the letters and memoranda which had developed
during his absence.</p>
<p>With quiet amusement Mary had agreed to the
investigation, watching him prowl among the files
with the same tolerant attitude she would have entertained
toward Luke had he insisted that he could
run the household more efficiently than a mere sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor tired boy,&rdquo; she used to think when Steve
would come into the office with a fagged look on his
handsome face and new lines steadily growing across
his forehead. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize yet&ndash;&ndash;you haven&rsquo;t
begun to realize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Steve, trying to catch up with work and plan
for the future, to respond graciously to every civic
call made upon him, would find himself enmeshed in
a desperate combination of Beatrice&rsquo;s dismay over the
cut of her new coat, her delight at the latest scandal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
her headaches, the special order for glac&eacute; chestnuts
he must not forget, the demand that he come home
for luncheon just because she wanted him to talk to,
the New York trip looming ahead with Bea coaxing
him to stay the entire time and let business slide
along as it would. All the while the an&aelig;sthesia of
unreality was lessening in its effect now that he had
attained his goal.</p>
<p>The rapt adoration he felt for his wife was in a
sense a rather subtle form of egotism he felt for himself.
The Gorgeous Girl or rather any Gorgeous
Girl personified his starved dreams and frantic
ambitions. He had turned his face toward such a
goal for so many tense years, goading himself on and
breathing in the an&aelig;sthesia of indifference and unreality
to all else about him that having obtained it
he now paused exhausted and about to make many
disconcerting discoveries. Had the Gorgeous Girl
had hair as black as his own or a nose such as Mary
Faithful&rsquo;s she would have still been his goal, symbol
of his aims.</p>
<p>Having finished the long battle Steve now felt an
urge to begin to battle for something else besides
wealth and social position. He felt ill at ease in
Beatrice&rsquo;s salon and among her friends, who all
seemed particularly inane and ridiculous, who were
all just as busy and tired and nervous as Beatrice
was for some strange reason, and who considered it
middle class not to smoke and common to show any
natural sentiment or emotion. He soon found it
was quite the thing to display the temperament of
an oyster when any vital issue was discussed or any
play, for example, had a scene of deep and inspiring
words. A queer little smirk or titter was the proper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
applause, but one must wax enthusiastic and superlative
over a clever burglary, a new-style dance, a
chafing-dish concoction, or, a risqu&eacute; story retold in
drawing-room language.</p>
<p>Before his marriage Beatrice had always been
terribly rushed and he had had more time in which
to work and glow with pride at the nearing of his
goal. She kept him at arm&rsquo;s length very cleverly
anchored with the two-carat engagement ring and
Steve had to fight for time and plead for an audience.
It fired his imagination, making him twice as keen
for the final capture.</p>
<p>But when two persons live in the same apartment,
notwithstanding the eleven rooms and so on, a monotony
of existence pervades even the grandeur of
velvet-panelled walls. There are the inevitable three
meals a day to be gone through with&ndash;&ndash;five meals if
tea and a supper party are counted. There are the
same ever-rising questions as to the cook&rsquo;s honesty
and the chauffeur&rsquo;s graft in the matter of buying,
new tires. There are just so many persons who have
to be wined and dined and who revenge themselves
by doing likewise to their former host; the everlasting
exchanging of courtesies and pleasantries&ndash;&ndash;all the
dull, decent habits of ultra living.</p>
<p>Steve found his small store of possessions huddled
into a corner, his pet slippers and gown graciously
bestowed upon a passing panhandler, and he was
obliged to don a very correct gray &ldquo;shroud,&rdquo; as he
named it in thankless terms, and to put his cigar
and cigar ashes into something having the earmarks
of an Etruscan coal scuttle, though Beatrice said it
was a priceless antique Gay had bought for a song!
There were many times when Steve would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
liked to roam about his house in plebeian shirt
sleeves, eat a plain steak and French-fried potatoes
with a hunk of homemade pie as a finish, and spend
the evening in that harmless, disorderly fashion known
to men of doing nothing but stroll about smoking,
playing semi-popular records, reading the papers, and
very likely having another hunk of pie at bedtime.</p>
<p>Besides all this there were the topics of the day
to discuss. During his courtship love was an all-absorbing
topic. There were many questions that
Beatrice asked that required intricate and tiring
answers. During the first six weeks of living at the
apartment Steve realized a telling difference between
men and women is that a woman demands a specific
case&ndash;&ndash;you must rush special incidents to back up
any theory you may advance&ndash;&ndash;whereas men, for the
most part, are content with abstract reasoning and
supply their own incidents if they feel inclined. Also
that a finely bred fragile type of woman such as
Beatrice inspires both fear and a maudlin sort of
sympathy, and that man is prevented from crossing
such a one to any great extent since men are as easily
conquered by maudlin sympathy as by fear.</p>
<p>When a yellow-haired child with dove-coloured eyes
manages to squeeze out a tear and at the same moment
depart in wrath to her room and lock the doors,
refusing to answer&ndash;&ndash;the trouble being why in
heaven&rsquo;s name must a pound-and-a-half spaniel
called Monster, nothing but a flea-bearing dust mop,
do nothing but sit and yap for chocolates?&ndash;&ndash;what
man is going to dare do otherwise than suppress a
little profanity and then go and whisper apologies at
the keyhole?</p>
<p>After several uncomfortable weeks of this sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
mental chaos Steve determined to do what many
business men do&ndash;&ndash;particularly the sort starting life
in an orphan asylum and ending by having residence
pipe organs and Russian wolfhounds frolicking at
their heels&ndash;&ndash;to bury himself in his work and defend
his seclusion by never refusing to write a check for
his wife. When he finally reached this decision he
was conscious of a strange joy.</p>
<p>Everything was a trifle too perfect to suit Steve.
The entire effect was that of the well-set stage of a
society drama. Beatrice was too correctly gowned and
coiffured, always upstage if any one was about, her
high-pitched, thin voice saying superlative nothings
upon the slightest provocation; or else she was dissolving
into tears and tantrums if no one was about.</p>
<p>Steve could not grasp the wherefore of having such
stress laid upon the exact position of a floor cushion
or the colour scheme for a bridge luncheon&ndash;&ndash;he would
have so rejoiced in really mediocre table service, in
less precision as to the various angles of the shades
or the unrumpled condition of the rugs. He had
not the oasis Mark Constantine had provided for
himself when he kept his room of old-fashioned trappings
apart from the rest of the mansion.</p>
<p>Steve needed such a room. He planned almost
guiltily upon building a shack in the woods whither
he could run when things became too impossible for
his peace of mind. If he could convince his wife that
a thing was smart or different from everything else
its success and welcome in their house were assured.
But an apple pie, a smelly pipe, a maidless dinner
table, or a disorderly den had never been considered
smart in Beatrice&rsquo;s estimation, and Steve never attempted
trying to change her point of view.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>Beatrice wondered, during moments of seriousness,
how it was that this handsome cave man of hers rebelled
so constantly against the beauty and correctness
of the apartment and yet never really disgraced
her as her own father would have done. It gave her
added admiration for Steve though she felt it would
be a mistake to tell him so. She did not believe in
letting her husband see that she was too much in love
with him.</p>
<p>Despite his growls and protests about this and that,
and his ignorance as to the things in life Beatrice
counted paramount, Steve adapted himself to the new
environment with a certain poise that astonished
everyone. The old saying &ldquo;Every Basque a noble&rdquo;
rang true in this descendant of a dark-haired, romantic
young woman whom his grandfather had married.
There was blood in Steve which Beatrice might have
envied had she been aware of it. But Steve was in
ignorance, and very willingly so, regarding his ancestors.
There had merely been &ldquo;my folks&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;which
began and ended the matter.</p>
<p>Still it was the thoroughbred strain which the
Basque woman had given her grandson that enabled
Steve to be master of his house even if he knew very
little of what it was all about. It was fortunate for
his peace of mind&ndash;&ndash;and pocketbook&ndash;&ndash;that Beatrice
had accepted the general rumour of a goat-tending
ancestry and pried no further. Had she ever
glimpsed the genealogy tables of the Benefacio
family, from which Steve descended, she would have
had the best time of all; coats of arms and family
crests and mottoes would have been the vogue; a trip
to the Pyrenees would have followed; mantillas and
rebozos would have crowded her wardrobe, and Steve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
would have been forced to learn Spanish and cultivate
a troubadourish air.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Gorgeous Girl was not willing that
her husband be buried in business. She could not
have so good a time without him&ndash;&ndash;besides, it was
meet that he acquired polish. Her father was a different
matter; everyone knew his ways and would
be as likely to try to change the gruff, harsh-featured
man as to try surveying Gibraltar with a penny
ruler. Now Beatrice had married Steve because
cave men were rather the mode, cave men who were
wonderfully successful and had no hampering relatives.
Besides, her father favoured Steve and he
would not have been amiable had he been forced to
accept a son-in-law of whom he did not approve.
Mark Constantine had never learned graciousness
of the heart, nor had his child.</p>
<p>So Beatrice proceeded to badger Steve whenever
he pleaded business, with the result that she kept
dropping in at his office, sometimes bringing friends,
coaxing him to close his desk and come and play for
the rest of the day. Sometimes she would peek in at
Mary Faithful&rsquo;s office and baby talk&ndash;&ndash;for Steve&rsquo;s
edification&ndash;&ndash;something like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ise a naughty dirl&ndash;&ndash;I is&ndash;&ndash;want somebody to play
wif me&ndash;&ndash;want to be amoosed. Do oo care? Nice,
busy lady&ndash;&ndash;big brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Often she would bring a gift for Mary in her surface
generous fashion&ndash;&ndash;a box of candy or a little silk
handkerchief. She pitied Mary as all butterflies pity
all ants, and she little knew that as soon as she had
departed Mary would open the window to let fresh air
drive out distracting perfume, and would look at the
useless trifle on her desk with scornful amusement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>Before the New York trip Steve took refuge in his
first deliberate lie to his wife. He had lied to himself
throughout his courtship but was most innocent
of the offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley telephones or calls please say
I have gone out to the stockyards,&rdquo; he told Mary.
&ldquo;And will you lend me your office for the afternoon?
I&rsquo;m so rushed I must be alone where I can work without
interruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary gathered up her papers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep you
under cover.&rdquo; She was smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of how very busy idle people
always are and of how much time busy people
always manage to make for the idle people&rsquo;s
demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer until he had collected his work
materials. Then he said: &ldquo;I should like to know just
what these idle people do with themselves but I
shall never have the time to find out.&rdquo; He vanished
into Mary&rsquo;s office, banging the door.</p>
<p>Beatrice telephoned that afternoon, only to be
given her husband&rsquo;s message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive out to the stockyards and get him,&rdquo;
she proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went with some men and I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;d
try it if I were you,&rdquo; Mary floundered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, have him call me up as soon as he
comes in. It is very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Steve reached home that night he found
Beatrice in a well-developed pout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my message?&rdquo; she demanded,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I was leaving the office. I looked in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
there on&ndash;&ndash;on my way back. I saw no use in telephoning
then. What is it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now. You have ruined my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. What is too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to go to Amityville with me; there
is a wonderful astrologer there who casts life horoscopes.
He predicted this whole war and the Bolsheviki
and bombs and everything, and I wanted
him to do ours. Alice Twill says he is positively
uncanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve shook his head. &ldquo;No long-haired cocoanut
throwers for mine,&rdquo; he said, briefly, unfolding his
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wanted you to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do not approve of such things; they are a
waste of time and money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my own money,&rdquo; she informed him, curtly.</p>
<p>Steve laid aside the paper. &ldquo;I have known that
for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, it is rude to refuse to call me when I have
asked you to do so. It makes me ridiculous in the
eyes of your employees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recalling the shift of offices Steve suppressed a
smile. &ldquo;It was nothing important, Bea, and I am
mighty busy. Your father never had time to play;
he worked a great deal harder than I have worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. You must not expect me to
be a little stay-at-home. You knew that before we
were even engaged. Besides, I&rsquo;m no child&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you act like one.&rdquo; He spoke almost
before he thought. &ldquo;You are a woman nearly
twenty-six years old, yet you haven&rsquo;t the poise of
girls eighteen that I have known. Still, they were
farm or working girls. I&rsquo;ve sometimes wondered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
what it is that makes you and your friends always
seem so childish and na&iuml;ve&ndash;&ndash;at times. Aren&rsquo;t you
ever going to grow up&ndash;&ndash;any of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want a pack of old women?&rdquo; she demanded.
&ldquo;How can you find fault with my friends?
You seem to forget how splendidly they have treated
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cave man must be muzzled, handcuffed, and
Under the an&aelig;sthetic of unreality and indifference to
be a satisfactory husband for a modern Gorgeous
Girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they treat me splendidly? I have
never robbed or maltreated any of them. Tell me
something. It is time we talked seriously. We
can&rsquo;t exist on the cream-puff kind of conversation.
What in the world has your way of going through
these finishing schools done for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dove-coloured eyes flickered angrily. &ldquo;I had
a terribly good time,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s the
proper thing&ndash;&ndash;girls don&rsquo;t come out at twenty and
marry off and let that be the end of it. You really
have a much better time now if you wait until you are
twenty-five, and then you somehow have learned
how to be a girl for an indefinite period. As for the
finishing school in America&ndash;&ndash;well, we had a wonderful
sorority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met college women who were clear-headed
persons deserving the best and usually attaining it&ndash;&ndash;but
I&rsquo;ve never taken a microscope to the sort of
women playing the game from the froth end. I&rsquo;m
wondering what your ideas were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You visited me&ndash;&ndash;you met my friends&ndash;&ndash;my
chaperons&ndash;&ndash;you wrote me each day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in love and busy making my fortune. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
was as shy as a backwoods product&ndash;&ndash;you know
that&ndash;&ndash;and afraid you would be carried off by someone
else before I could come up to the sum your father
demanded of me. I have nothing but a hazy idea as
to a great many girls of all sorts and sizes&ndash;&ndash;and
mostly you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had wonderful lectures and things; and
I had a wonderful crush on some of the younger
teachers&ndash;&ndash;that is a great deal of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crushes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have crushes unless you&rsquo;re a nobody&ndash;&ndash;and
there&rsquo;s nothing so much a lark. You select your
crush and then you rush her. I had a darling teacher,
she is doing war work in Paris now. She was a doll.
I adored her the moment I saw her and I sent her
presents and left flowers in her room, orchids on
Sundays, until she made me stop. One day a whole
lot of us who had been rushing her clipped off locks
of our hair and fastened them in little gauze bags and
we strung a doll clothes line across her room and
pinned the little bags on it and left a note for her
saying: &lsquo;Your scalp line!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did that amount to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was fun. And I had another crush right
after that one. Then some of the classes were
interesting. I liked psychology best of all because
you could fake the answers and cram for exams more
easily. Math. and history require facts. There
was one perfectly thrilling experience with fish. You
know fish distinguish colours, one from the other,
and are guided by colour sense rather than a sense of
smell. We had red sticks and green sticks and blue
sticks in a tank of fish, and for days we put the fish
food on the green sticks and the fish would swim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
right over to get it, and then we put it on the red
sticks and they still swam over to the green sticks and
waited round&ndash;&ndash;so it was recognizing colour and not
the food. And a lot of things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve laughed. &ldquo;I hope the fish wised up in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice looked at him disapprovingly. &ldquo;If you
had gone to college it might have made a great
difference,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll let the rest of
the boys wait on the fishes. Did you go to domestic
science this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was omelet. Mine was like leather. The
gas stove makes my head ache. But we are going to
have a Roman pageant to close the season&ndash;&ndash;all about
a Roman matron, and that will be lots of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You eat too much candy; that is what makes
your head ache,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>She pretended not to hear him. &ldquo;It is time to
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s a party to-night,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is, and you know it. The Homers
are giving a dinner for their daughter. Everyone is
to wear their costumes wrong side out. Isn&rsquo;t that
clever? I laid out a white linen suit for you; it will
look so well turned inside out; and I am going to wear
an organdie that has a wonderful satin lining.
There is no reason why we must be frumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay home and play cribbage,&rdquo; Steve
said, almost wistfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a rain creeping up.
Let&rsquo;s not go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate staying home when it is raining.&rdquo; Beatrice
went into her room to try the effect of a sash
wrong side out. &ldquo;It is so dull in a big drawing room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
when there are just two people,&rdquo; she added, as Steve
appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two people make a home,&rdquo; he found himself
answering.</p>
<p>The Gorgeous Girl glanced at him briefly, during
which instant she seemed quite twenty-six years old
and the spoiled daughter of a rich man, the childish,
senseless part of her had vanished. &ldquo;Would you
please take Monster into the kitchen for her supper?&rdquo;
she asked, almost insolently.</p>
<p>So the owner of the O&rsquo;Valley Leather Works found
his solace in tucking the pound-and-a-half spaniel
under his arm and trying to convince himself that he
was all wrong and a self-made man must keep a watch
on himself lest he become a boor!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The day the O&rsquo;Valleys left for New York in company
with three other couples Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord
Vondeplosshe arrived in Hanover, having visited until
their welcome was not alone worn out but impossible
ever to be replaced. A social item in the
evening paper stated that they had taken an apartment
at the Graystone and would be at home to
their friends&ndash;&ndash;whoever they might be.</p>
<p>If Gay&rsquo;s club and his friends had determined
merely to be polite and not welcome his wife, Trudy
had determined that they would not only welcome
her but insist upon being helpful to them; as for her
former associates&ndash;&ndash;they would be treated to a curt
bow. This, however, did not include the Faithfuls.
Mary was not to be ignored, nor did Trudy wish to
ignore her. All the good that was in Trudy responded
to Mary&rsquo;s goodness. She never tried to be
to Mary&ndash;&ndash;no one did more than once. Nor did she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
try to flatter her. She was truly sorry for Mary&rsquo;s
colourless life, truly grieved that Mary would not
consent to shape her eyebrows. But she respected
her, and it was to Mary&rsquo;s house that Mrs. Vondeplosshe
repaired shortly after her arrival.</p>
<p>It was quite true that Beatrice Constantine would
have developed much as Trudy had were the pampered
person compelled to earn her living, and, like
Trudy, too, would have married a half portion, bankrupt
snob. As Trudy dashed into the Faithful
living room, kissing Mary and her mother and
shaking a finger at Luke, Mary thought what a
splendid imitation she was of Beatrice returning
from her honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As pretty as a picture,&rdquo; Mrs. Faithful declared,
quite chirked up by the bridal atmosphere. &ldquo;How
do you do it, Trudy? And why didn&rsquo;t you write us
something besides postals? They always seem like
printed handbills to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially mine,&rdquo; Luke protested. &ldquo;One of
Sing Sing with the line: &lsquo;I am thinking of you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy giggled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a minute and I
bought postals in flocks. Oh, I adore New York!
I&rsquo;m wild to live there. I nearly passed away in New
England, but of course we had to stay as long as they
would have us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at herself in a mirror, conscious of
Mary&rsquo;s amused expression. She wore a painfully
bright blue tailored suit&ndash;&ndash;she had made the skirt
herself and hunted up a Harlem tailor to do the
jacket&ndash;&ndash;round-toed, white leather shoes stitched
with bright blue, white silk stockings, an aviatrix cap
of blue su&eacute;de, and a white fox fur purchased at half
price at a fire sale.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any new jewellery except my wedding
ring,&rdquo; she mourned. &ldquo;I expected Gay&rsquo;s sister to
give me one of her mother&rsquo;s diamond earrings&ndash;&ndash;I
think she might have. They are lovely stones&ndash;&ndash;but
she never made a move that way&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s horrid. As
soon as I can afford to be independent I shall cut her,
for she did her best to politely ask us to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were there several weeks, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Mary ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I grew tame. I learned a lot from her&ndash;&ndash;I
was pretty crude in some ways.&rdquo; Which was true.
Trudy was quite as well-bred looking, at first glance,
as the Gorgeous Girl. &ldquo;It is always better to get
your experience where the neighbours aren&rsquo;t watching.
I didn&rsquo;t lose a minute. If I never did an honest day&rsquo;s
work for Steve O&rsquo;Valley I worked like a steam
engine learning how to be a real lady, the sort Gay
tried to marry but couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you weren&rsquo;t a little lady at all times,&rdquo; Mrs.
Faithful added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we are stony broke but Gay&rsquo;s brother-in-law
just had to loan us some money in order to
have us go. They gave us fifty dollars for a wedding
present. Well, it was better than nothing. Gay
has talked to a lot of concert managers and he&rsquo;s going
to have some wonderful attractions next season.
People have never taken Gaylord seriously; he really
has had to discover himself, and he is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you practising small talk on me?&rdquo; Mary
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said it,&rdquo; Trudy admitted. &ldquo;That last is
the way I&rsquo;m going to talk about Gaylord to his
friends. I&rsquo;ll make him a success if he will only mind
me. Just think&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be calling on Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
before long! She will have to know me because
Gay helped furnish her apartment and was one of her
ushers. It will mean everything for us to know her&ndash;&ndash;and
I&rsquo;m never going to appear at all down and out,
either. People never take you seriously if you seem
to need money. Debt can&rsquo;t frighten me. I was
raised on it. All I need is Gay&rsquo;s family reputation
and my own hair and teeth and I&rsquo;ll breeze in before
any of the other entries. I came to ask if you won&rsquo;t
come to see where I live?&rdquo; She smiled her prettiest.
&ldquo;Gay is at his club and we can talk. It was quite a
bomb in the enemies&rsquo; camp when he married&ndash;&ndash;people
just can&rsquo;t dun a married man like they do a
bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come next week.&rdquo; Mary tried putting off
the evil day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;now. I want your advice&ndash;&ndash;and to show
you my clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have clothes, Trudy, when you don&rsquo;t
have food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to these days&ndash;&ndash;no good time unless
you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed Mrs. Faithful and promised to have
them all up for dinner. Then she tucked her arm
in Mary&rsquo;s and pranced down the street with her,
talking at top speed of how horrid it was that they
had to walk and not drive in a cab like Beatrice,
and concluding with a dissertation on Gaylord&rsquo;s
mean disposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mean, Mary, unless I want to accomplish
something&ndash;&ndash;but Gaylord is mean on general principle.
He sulks and tells silly lies when you come to
really know him. Oh, I&rsquo;m not madly in love&ndash;&ndash;but
we can get along without throwing things. It&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
better than marrying a clod-hopper who couldn&rsquo;t
show me anything better than his mother&rsquo;s green-plush
parlour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem hard to have to pretend to love
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s so stupid,&rdquo; said the debonair Mrs. Vondeplosshe
as she brought Mary up before the entrance
of the Graystone, a cheap apartment house with a
marble entrance that extended only a quarter of the
way up; from there on ordinary wood and marbleized
paper finished the deed. The Vondeplosshes had a
rear apartment. Their windows looked upon ash
cans and delivery entrances, the front apartments
with their bulging bay windows being twenty-five
dollars a month more rent. As it was, they were
paying forty-five, and very lucky to have the chance
to pay it.</p>
<p>Trudy unlocked the door with a flourish. All that
Trudy had considered as really essential to the making
of a home was a phonograph and a pier glass;
the rest was simple&ndash;&ndash;rent a furnished place and wear
out someone else&rsquo;s things. The bandbox of a place
with four cell-like rooms was by turns pitiful and
amusing to Mary Faithful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are just starting from here,&rdquo; Trudy reminded
her as she watched the gray eyes flicker with humour
or narrow with displeasure. &ldquo;Wait and see&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ll
soon be living neighbour to the O&rsquo;Valleys. Besides,
there is such an advantage in being married. You
don&rsquo;t have to worry for fear you&rsquo;ll be an&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old maid,&rdquo; finished Mary. &ldquo;Out with it! You
can&rsquo;t frighten me. I hope you and Gay never try
changing your minds at the same time, for it would
be a squeeze.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>She selected a fragile gilt chair in the tiny living
room with its imitation fireplace and row of painted
imitation books in the little bookcase. This was in
case the tenants had no books of their own&ndash;&ndash;which
the Vondeplosshes had not. If they possessed a
library they could easily remove the painted board
and give it to the janitor for safekeeping. There
were imitation Oriental rugs and imitation-leather
chairs and imitation-mahogany furniture, plated
silver, and imitations of china and of linen were to be
found in the small three-cornered dining room, which
resembled a penurious wedge of cake, Mary thought
as she tried saying something polite. The imitation
extended to the bedroom with its wall bed and
built-in chiffonier and dresser of gaudy walnut.
Trudy had promptly cluttered up the last-mentioned
article with smart-looking cretonne and near-ivory
toilet articles. There was even a pathetic little
wardrobe trunk they had bought for $28.75 in New
York, and Trudy had painstakingly soaked off old
European hotel labels she had found on one of Gay&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s satchels and repasted them on the trunk to
give the impression of travel and money.</p>
<p>The kitchen was nothing but a dark hole with a
rusty range and nondescript pots and pans. &ldquo;Being
in the kitchen gets me nothing, so why bother
about it?&rdquo; Trudy explained, hardly opening the
door. &ldquo;We have no halls or furnace to care for,
and an apartment house sounds so well when you
give an address. I wish we could have afforded a
front one; it will be hard to have people climbing
through the back halls. I have put in a good supply
of canned soups and vegetables and powdered puddings,
and we can save a lot on our food. We&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
be invited out, too, and when we eat at home I can
get a meal in a few minutes and I&rsquo;ll make Gay wash
the dishes. Besides, I have a wonderful recipe for
vanishing cream that his sister bought in Paris, and
I&rsquo;m going to have a little business myself, making it
to supply to a few select customers as a favour. I&rsquo;ll
sell small jars for a dollar and large ones for three,
and I can make liquid face powder, too. Oh, we
won&rsquo;t starve. And if you could wait for the money
I know I owe you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it a wedding present,&rdquo; Mary said, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lamb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy fell on her neck and was in the throes of
explaining how grateful she was and how she had an
evening dress modelled after one of Gay&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s,
which cost seven hundred dollars before the war,
when Gay appeared&ndash;&ndash;very debonair and optimistic
in his checked suit, velours hat, and toothpick-toed
tan shoes, and his pale little eyes were quite animated
as he kissed Trudy and dutifully shook hands with
Mary, explaining that the Hunters of Arcadia had just
offered him a clerical position at the club, ordering
supplies and making out bills and so on&ndash;&ndash;because he
was married, very likely. It would pay forty a
month and his lunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only take up your mornings! You can slip
extra sandwiches in your pockets for me, deary. I&rsquo;ll
give you a rubber-pocketed vest for a Christmas present,&rdquo;
Trudy exclaimed. &ldquo;Oh, say everything in
front of Mary&ndash;&ndash;she knows what we really are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which Mary fled, with the general after impression
of pale, wicked eyes and a checked suit and a
dashing, red-haired young matron with a can opener
always on hand, and the fact that the Vondeplosshes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
were going to lay siege to the O&rsquo;Valleys as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>Mary decided that it was a great privilege to be a
profane lady concealing a heartache compared to
other alternatives. At least heartaches were quite
real.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>It was almost Christmas week before the realization
of Trudy&rsquo;s ambition to have Beatrice
call upon her as the wife of Gaylord Vondeplosshe
instead of an unimportant employee of her
own husband. Trudy counted upon Beatrice to
help her far more than Gaylord dared to hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bea is like all her sort,&rdquo; he warned Trudy when
the point of Beatrice&rsquo;s having to invite the Vondeplosshes
for dinner was close at hand; &ldquo;she is crazy
about herself and her money. She would cheat for
ten cents and then turn right round and buy a thousand-dollar
dress without questioning the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which was true. Beatrice had never had to acquire
any sense of values regarding either money or
character. By turns she was penurious and lavish,
suspecting a maid of stealing a sheet of notepaper
and then writing a handsome check for a charity in
which she had only a passing interest. She would
send her soiled finery to relief committees, and when
someone told her that satin slippers and torn chiffon
frocks were not practical she would say in injured
astonishment: &ldquo;Sell them and use the money. I
never have practical clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a maid pleased her Beatrice pampered her until
she became overbearing, and there would be a scene
in which the maid would be told to pack her things
and depart without any prospect of a reference; and
someone else would be rushed into her place, only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
to have the same experience. Beatrice was like most
indulged and superfluously rich women, both unreasonable
and foolishly lenient in her demands. She
had no schedule, no routine, no rules either for herself
or others. She had been denied the chance of
developing and discovering her own limitations and
abilities. She expected her maids and her friends
to be at her beck and call twenty-four hours out of
the twenty-four, she would not accept an excuse of
being unfitted by illness for some task or of not knowing
how to do any intricate, unheard-of thing which
suddenly it occurred to her must be done.</p>
<p>When a servant would plead her case Beatrice
always told her that for days at a time she left her
alone in her beautiful home with nothing to do but
keep it clean and eat up all her food and very likely
give parties and use her talking machine and piano&ndash;&ndash;which
was quite true&ndash;&ndash;and that she must consider
this when she was asked to stay on duty until three
or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning or be up at five o&rsquo;clock
with an elaborate breakfast for Beatrice and her
friends just returning from a fancy-dress ball.</p>
<p>On a sunny day she often sent the maids driving
in her car, and if a blizzard came up she was certain
to ask them to walk downtown to match yarn for her,
not even offering car fare. She would borrow small
sums and stamps from them and deliberately forget
to pay them back, at the same time giving her cook a
forty-dollar hat because it made her own self look too
old. She had never had any one but herself to rely
upon for discipline, and whenever she wanted anything
she had merely to ask for it. When anything
displeased her it was removed without question.</p>
<p>American business men do not always toil until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
they are middle-aged for the reward of being made a
fool by a chorus girl or an adventuress. That belongs
to yellow-backed penny-dreadfuls and Sunday
supplement tales of breach-of-promise suits.
More often the daughter of the business man is both
the victim and the vampire of his own shortsighted
neglectfulness. The business man expresses it as
&ldquo;working like a slave to give her the best in the land.&rdquo;
And sometimes, as in the case of Steve O&rsquo;Valley, it
is his own wife instead of a blonde soul mate who lures
him to destruction in six installments.</p>
<p>When Beatrice first knew of Gaylord&rsquo;s return she
was inclined to pay no attention to his wife, despite
her remarks to Steve. Then Gaylord telephoned,
and she had him up for afternoon tea, during which
he told her all about it. He was very diplomatic in
his undertaking. He pictured Trudy as a diamond
in the rough, and in subtle, careful fashion gave Beatrice
to understand that just as she had married a
diamond in the rough&ndash;&ndash;with a Virginia City grandfather
and a Basque grandmother and the champion
record of goat tending&ndash;&ndash;so he, too, had been democratic
enough to put aside precedent and marry a
charming, unspoiled little person with both beauty
and ability, and certainly he was to be congratulated
since he had been married for love alone, Truletta
knowing full well his unfortunate and straitened circumstances....
Yes, her people lived in Michigan
but were uncongenial. Still, there was good
blood in the family only it was a long ways back,
probably as far back as the age of spear fighting,
and he relied upon Beatrice, his old playmate, to
sympathize with and uphold his course.</p>
<p>Secretly annoyed that the tables had been so skillfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
turned, yet not willing to admit it to this bullying
morsel, Beatrice was obliged to say she would
call upon his wife and ask them for dinner the following
week.</p>
<p>Gaylord fairly floated home, to find Trudy remodelling
a dress, scraps of fur and shreds of satin on
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babseley, she&rsquo;s coming to call to-morrow!&rdquo; he
said, joyfully, hanging up his velours hat and straddling
a little gilt chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? I wish we had a better place. I feel
at a disadvantage. If it were a man I wouldn&rsquo;t
mind, I could act humble and brave&ndash;&ndash;that sort of
dope. But it never goes with a woman; you have to
bully a rich woman, and I&rsquo;m wondering if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said, his pale eyes twinkling with delight.
&ldquo;It was easy, too. I dragged in O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s
orphan-asylum days and all, and how we both
married diamonds in the rough. Woof, how she
squirmed!&rdquo; He rose and went to the absurd little buffet,
pouring out two glasses of &ldquo;red ink&rdquo; and gulping
down one of them. &ldquo;I wish I had O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s money;
I&rsquo;d put away a houseful of this stuff. I&rsquo;m going to
dig up a few bottles at the club&ndash;&ndash;in case of illness.&rdquo;
Trudy did not want her glass, so he drank that as
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take too much of that stuff,&rdquo; Trudy warned,
gathering up her d&eacute;bris; &ldquo;and when you have taken
too much you talk too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaylord rewarded her by consuming a third glass.
&ldquo;Shall we eat out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Too expensive. There&rsquo;s no
need for it now. I bought some potato salad and I
have canned pineapple and sugar cookies.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>She dumped her work into a basket and flew round
the dining room until she summoned Gaylord to join
her in a meal laid out on the corner of a dingy luncheon
table.</p>
<p>The wine dulled Gay&rsquo;s appetite and Trudy&rsquo;s had
been taken quite away by Beatrice&rsquo;s proposed visit.
Besides, they put the latest jazz record on their little
talking machine, which helped substitute for a decent
meal. They danced a little while and then Trudy
planned what she should wear for the O&rsquo;Valley dinner
party and Gaylord figured how much money he
needed before he would dare try buying an automobile,
and they finished the evening by attending the
nine-o&rsquo;clock movie performance and buying fifteen
cents&rsquo; worth of lemon ice and two sponge cakes to
bring home as a pi&egrave;ce de resistance.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Beatrice found herself amused instead of annoyed
as she climbed the stairs to the Vondeplosshe residence.
At Trudy&rsquo;s request Gay had discreetly consented
to be absent. He had pretty well picked up
the threads of his various enterprises and what with
his club duties, his second-rate concerts, his gambling,
and commissions from antique dealers, he managed
to put in what he termed a full day. So he swung out
of the house early in the afternoon to buy himself a
new winter outfit, wondering if Trudy would row
when she discovered the fact.</p>
<p>Gaylord&rsquo;s theory of married life was &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
mine is my own, and what&rsquo;s yours is mine.&rdquo; He
relied on Trudy to mend his clothes and make his
neckties, keep house and manage with a laundress a
half day a week, yet always be as well dressed and
pretty as when she had slacked in the office and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
boarded without cares at Mary&rsquo;s house. She must
always seem happy and proud of her husband and
have her old pep&ndash;&ndash;being on the lookout for a way to
make their fortunes. She must also remain as young
looking as ever and always be at his beck and call.
Gaylord was rapidly developing into an impossible
little bully, the usual result of an impoverished snob
who manages to become a barnacle-like fixture on
someone a trifle more foolish yet better of nature than
himself.</p>
<p>Had he been less aristocratic of family and stronger
of brawn he would have beaten Trudy if she displeased
him. As it was, after the first flush of romance
passed, he began to sneer at her in private
when she made mistakes in the ways of the smart set
into which Gaylord had been born, and when she
protested he only sneered the louder. He felt Trudy
should be eternally grateful to him. Trudy found
herself bewildered, hurt&ndash;&ndash;yet unable to combat his
contemptible little laughs and sneers. Trudy was
shallow and she knew not the meaning of the word
&ldquo;ideal,&rdquo; but for the most part she was rather amiable
and unless she had a certain goal to attain she wished
everyone about her to be happy and content. As
she had married Gaylord only as a stepping-stone she
was fair enough to remind herself of this fact when
unpleasant developments occurred. As long as
he was useful to her she was not going to seize upon
pin-pricks and try to make them into actual
wounds.</p>
<p>She decided to wear her one decent tea gown when
Beatrice called, pleading a bad headache as an excuse
for its appearance. She knew the tea gown was an
excellent French model, a hand-me-down from Gay&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
sister, and her nimble fingers had cleaned and mended
the trailing pink-silk loveliness until it would make
quite a satisfactory first impression.</p>
<p>She cleaned the apartment, recklessly bought cut
flowers, bonbons, and two fashion magazines to give
an impression of plenty. She even set old golf clubs
and motor togs in the tiny hall, and she timed Beatrice&rsquo;s
arrival so as to put the one grand-opera record
on the talking machine just as she was coming up the
stairs.</p>
<p>Then she ran to the door in pretty confusion, to
say spiritedly: &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley, so good of you.
I&rsquo;m ever so happy to have you. I&rsquo;m afraid it isn&rsquo;t
proper to be wearing this old tea gown but I had a bad
headache this morning and I stayed in bed until
nearly luncheon, then I slipped into the first thing
handy.... Oh, no. Only a nervous headache.
We took too long a motor trip yesterday, the sun was
so bright.... No, indeed; you do not make
my headache worse. It&rsquo;s better right this
minute.... Now please don&rsquo;t laugh at our
little place. Can&rsquo;t you play you&rsquo;re a doll and this is
the house you were supposed to live in? I do&ndash;&ndash;I
find myself laughing every time I really take time to
stand back and look at the rooms.... Put
your coat here. Such a charming one, the skins are
so exquisitely matched. I do so want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had such an honest, innocent expression that
Beatrice found herself won over to the cause. Trudy
understood Beatrice at first sight; she knew how to
proceed without blundering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here, Mrs. Steve, for I can&rsquo;t call you Mrs.
O&rsquo;Valley with Gay singing the praises of Bea and
Beatrice and the Gorgeous Girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;call me Beatrice,&rdquo; she found herself saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderful! But only on condition that I
am Trudy to you. How pleased Gay is going to be!
He adores you. You have no idea of how much he
talks about you and approves all you do and say. I
used to be a teeny weeny bit jealous of you when I
was a poor little nobody.&rdquo; She passed the chocolates,
nodding graciously as Beatrice selected the
largest one in the box.</p>
<p>Trudy chattered ahead: &ldquo;I was glancing through
these fashion books this afternoon to get an idea for
an afternoon dress. Of course I can&rsquo;t have wonderful
things like you have&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;looking with envy at the
Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s black-velvet costume&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;still, I don&rsquo;t
mind. When one is happy mere things do not
matter, do they&ndash;&ndash;Beatrice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice hesitated. Then she fortified herself by
another bonbon. This strange girl was both interesting
and dangerous. Certainly she was not to
be snubbed or ridiculed. Vaguely Beatrice tried to
analyze her hostess, but as she had never been called
upon to judge human nature she was sluggish in even
trying to exercise her faculties.</p>
<p>In China fathers have their daughters&rsquo; feet bound
and make them sleep away from the house so their
moans will not disturb the family. In America
fathers often repress their daughters&rsquo; self-sufficiency
and intellect by bonds of self-indulgence, and when the
daughters realize that a stockade of dollars is a most
flimsy fortress in the world against the experiences
which come to every man and woman the American
girls are the mental complement of their physically tortured
Chinese cousins&ndash;&ndash;hopeless and without redress.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You have made this place look well,&rdquo; Beatrice
said, presently, &ldquo;It is a perfect tinder box. Papa
knows the man who built it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy flushed. &ldquo;We are merely trying out love in
a cliffette,&rdquo; she said, sweetly, &ldquo;instead of the old-style
cottage. We can&rsquo;t expect anything like your
apartment. We have that prospect to look forward
to. Besides, we have the advantage of knowing just
who our real friends are,&rdquo; she added, smiling her
prettiest.</p>
<p>Beatrice disposed of another chocolate. She told
herself she was being placed in an awkward position.
She had occasion to keep thinking so every moment of
her visit, for Trudy hastened to add that she had
never liked office work and yet Mr. O&rsquo;Valley had
been so good to her, and wasn&rsquo;t it splendid that
America was a country where one had a chance and
could rise to whatsoever place one deserved; and
when one thought of Beatrice&rsquo;s own dear papa and
handsome husband, well, it was all quite inspiring
and wonderful&ndash;&ndash;until Beatrice was as uncomfortable
about Steve&rsquo;s goat tending and her father&rsquo;s marital
selection of a farmer&rsquo;s hired girl as Trudy really was
of the apartment and her second-hand frock.</p>
<p>Trudy lost no time in introducing the magic
vanishing-cream and liquid face power, and before
the call ended Beatrice had ordered five dollars&rsquo;
worth of each and some for Aunt Belle, and she had
offered to take Trudy to her bridge club some time
soon.</p>
<p>As the door closed Trudy sank back in her chair,
informing the imitation fireplace joyously: &ldquo;It was
almost too easy; I didn&rsquo;t have to work as hard as I
really wanted to.&rdquo; Wearily she dragged off her tea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
gown for a bungalow apron and then prepared a
supper of delicatessen baked beans and instantaneous
pudding for her lord and master.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The dinner with the O&rsquo;Valleys was equally fruitful
of results. Despite Steve&rsquo;s protests that he did not
wish to know Gay and that Trudy was impossible he
was forced to listen to their inane jokes and absurd
flatteries and to look at Trudy in her taupe chiffon
with exclamatory strands of burnt ostrich, and
watch her deft fashion of handling his wife, realizing
that people with one-cylinder brains and smart-looking,
redheaded wives usually get by with things!</p>
<p>After their guests had departed Steve began
brusquely: &ldquo;Do you like&rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I told you before that they amused me.
She is fun, and poor Gay is a dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to have them round all the time?
That woman&rsquo;s laugh gets on my nerves, and I want
him shot at sunrise. They can&rsquo;t talk about anything
but the movies and jazz dancing and clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want them to talk about? Don&rsquo;t
pace up and down like a wild beast.&rdquo; Beatrice came
up and stood before him to prevent his turning the
corner.</p>
<p>He looked down at her without answering. She
was clad in shimmering white loveliness cut along
the same medieval lines as the gown another Beatrice
had worn when Dante first saw her walking by the
Arno; her hair was very sunshiny and fragrant and
her dove-coloured eyes most appealing.</p>
<p>He burst out laughing at his own protest. &ldquo;Am I
a bear? Come and kiss me. If you like them or
they amuse you just tote &rsquo;em about, darling. Only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
can&rsquo;t you manage to do it while I am out of town?
They do fleck me on the raw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hermit&ndash;&ndash;beast,&rdquo; she dimpled and shook her
finger at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want you,&rdquo; he said, simply; &ldquo;or else people
who can do something besides spend money or sponge
round for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you frighten me&ndash;&ndash;you sound booky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not; I want real things, Bea. I feel hungry
for plain people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have them all day long in your office and
your shops; I should think when you come home
you&rsquo;d welcome a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our definitions differ. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m not going to
find fault with your friends. I&rsquo;ve nothing against
them except that they are time wasters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trudy boarded at your wonderful Miss Faithful&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of Mary&rsquo;s common sense, and not
because of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a great deal of that girl, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she asked, patting his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She deserves a great deal of credit; she has
worked since she was thirteen, and she is as true-blue
as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she will ever marry and leave you?&rdquo;
she asked, laying the sunshiny head on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want her to; I&rsquo;d feel like buying off any
prospective bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair.&rdquo; Her hand stole up to pat his
cheek. &ldquo;She has the right to be happy&ndash;&ndash;as we are,
Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at her in all her lovely uselessness.
&ldquo;You funny little wife,&rdquo; he whispered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;fighting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
over losing a postage stamp one minute and buying
a new motor car the next; going to luncheon with the
washed of Hanover and spending the afternoon with
Trudy; making fun of Mary Faithful&rsquo;s shirt waists
and then pleading for her woman&rsquo;s happiness....
Beatrice, you&rsquo;ve never had half a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The next afternoon Mary and Luke Faithful were
summoned home. Later in the day Steve received
word that their mother had succumbed to a violent
heart attack. He found himself feeling concerned
and truly sorry, wondering if Mary had any one to
see to things and relieve her of the responsibility.
Then he wondered if this death would cause a dormant
affection to become active love as often happens,
causing him to lose his right-hand man. He
reproached himself for knowing so little of her
private life. When he went into her deserted office
to find a letter it seemed distinctly lonesome. It
was hard to realize how suddenly things happen and
how easily the world at large becomes accustomed to
radical changes. Already a snub-nosed little clerk
was taking up a collection for the flowers.</p>
<p>For the first time in years Steve felt depressed and
weary. The anaesthesia was losing its power.</p>
<p>Within the coming week as vital a mental change
was to come to Steve as the death of Mrs. Faithful
was to cause in Mary&rsquo;s life. And as Mary, to all
purposes, would resume her business routine with not
a hint of the change, so would Steve fail to betray the
mental revolution that was to take place in his
hitherto ambitious and obedient brain.</p>
<p>Briefly what was to happen was this&ndash;&ndash;after visiting
Mary in her home and after seeing the Gorgeous Girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
during a test of one&rsquo;s abilities, Steve was to realize that
there are two kinds of person in the world: Those
who make brittle, detailed plans, and those who have
but a steadfast purpose. His wife belonged to the
former class and Mary to the latter, which he was to
discover was his choice at all times!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>The day of Mrs. Faithful&rsquo;s funeral was the day
that Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley had arranged to introduce
Trudy Vondeplosshe to her bridge club,
the members of which were keen to see Gay&rsquo;s wife in
order to prove whether or not Bea&rsquo;s report concerning
her was correct&ndash;&ndash;that she was a clever young
person quite capable of taking care of both her own
and Gay&rsquo;s futures.</p>
<p>Beatrice particularly looked forward to the afternoon.
Introducing Trudy served as an attraction,
and besides the hostess had telephoned her that she
had just received a box of Russian sweetmeats made
by a refugee who was starting life anew in New York,
and two barrels of china, each barrel containing but
three plates and each plate being valued at six
hundred dollars. Furthermore, Beatrice was wearing
an afternoon costume that would demand no
small share of attention, and there was the additional
joy of dazzling Trudy by her tapestry-lined winter
car. So when Steve reminded her in a matter-of-fact
way that the funeral services for Mrs. Faithful were
to be at three she stared in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, I am very sorry your secretary&rsquo;s
muzzy has died&ndash;&ndash;but I cannot change my plans. I
accepted for both Trudy Vondeplosshe and myself
more than a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve wondered if he had heard correctly. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t imagine for an instant that Trudy will not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
go? She boarded there; they did everything for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;She was phoning
me before lunch and is all agog with excitement.
Poor little thing, it means a lot for her. She will be
ready at three and I am to call for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she understands the funeral is to-day.
I know she is heartless and shallow, but even
she would scarcely omit such a duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice gave a long sigh. &ldquo;Dear me, you ought
to have been an evangelist. I can&rsquo;t understand why
you suddenly become punctilious and altruistic. For
years you never did anything but try to make money
and wonder if I would marry you&ndash;&ndash;you never cared
who was dead or what happened as long as you were
secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true. But I have made a fortune and
married you, and it is time for other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to them,&rdquo; she said, quite enjoying
the argument. &ldquo;Besides, I sent my card with
the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the same as going yourself, it is your duty
to go, Bea. The girl has taken the brunt of business
while we played and she has only the reward of a
salary. Her mother has died, which means that her
home is gone. I call it thick to choose a bridge party
instead of paying a humane debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I dragged into it? She isn&rsquo;t working
for me! Papa never asked me to go when any of his
people had relatives who died. I don&rsquo;t think he ever
went himself unless there was a claim to be adjusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t ask it if it were any one else&ndash;&ndash;but
Mary Faithful is different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite ardent in your defence of her. Be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
sensible, Steve. What does it matter whether I go
or don&rsquo;t go? I think it quite enough if you appear.
Now if she were in need of actual money&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly!&rdquo; he said, bitterly. &ldquo;That would
give you the chance to play off Lady Bountiful, drive
up in state with your check book and accept figurative
kisses on the hand! But when a plain American
business girl who has served me more loyally than
she has herself loses her mother you won&rsquo;t be a few
moments late at a bridge party in order to pay her
the respect employers should pay their employees. I
don&rsquo;t blame Trudy&ndash;&ndash;I expect nothing of her&ndash;&ndash;but I
do blame you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my plans are to be set aside&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plans!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;If someone else were
to tell you that they had an East Indian yogi who was
going to give a seance this very afternoon you would
hotfoot it to the telephone to inform Trudy that you
must break your engagement with her, and send word
to your original hostess as well. That is about all
your plans amount to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice&rsquo;s eyes had grown slanting, shining with
rage. &ldquo;I wish you would remember you are speaking
to your wife and not to an employee. I would
not go to that funeral now if it meant&ndash;&ndash;if it meant a
divorce.&rdquo; She pushed her chair back from the
table&ndash;&ndash;they were at luncheon&ndash;&ndash;and stood up indignantly.</p>
<p>Looking at her in her gay light chiffon with its
traceries of gold Steve wondered vaguely whether or
not he had been wrong in selecting his goal, whether
he would ever be able really to understand this
Gorgeous Girl now that she belonged to him, or would
discover that there was nothing much to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
about her, that it could all be summed up in the
statement that her father by denying her a chance at
development had stunted the growth of her ability
and her character into raggle-taggle weeds of self-indulgence
and willful temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not ask you to go with me,&rdquo; he knew he
answered. It is quite as terrifying to find that one&rsquo;s
goal has been wrongly chosen and ethically unsound
as to find a boyhood dream merging into gorgeous
reality.</p>
<p>Beatrice swept out of the room. Steve made an
elaborate pretense of finishing his meal. Then he
went into the drawing room in search of a newspaper.
He came upon Beatrice sitting on a floor cushion,
feeding Monster some bonbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been at her house?&rdquo; she said, curiosity
overcoming the pique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Where is that paper? I dropped it in this
chair when I came in for luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it taken away. I abominate newspapers in
a drawing room&ndash;&ndash;or muddy shoes,&rdquo; she added,
looking at his own. &ldquo;What did she say? What
sort of a house is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve stared at her in bewilderment. &ldquo;What the
devil difference does it make to you?&rdquo; he demanded,
roughly.</p>
<p>She gave a little scream. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare say
such things to me.&rdquo; Then she began to cry very
prettily in a singsong, high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Monster&ndash;&ndash;nobody
loves us&ndash;&ndash;nobody loves us&ndash;&ndash;we can&rsquo;t
have a merry Christmas after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be home for dinner,&rdquo; Steve added more
politely. &ldquo;Miss Faithful&rsquo;s absence just now makes
things quite rushed&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll work until late.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>Beatrice sprang up, letting Monster scramble unheeded
to the floor. &ldquo;Oh, you are trying to punish
me!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;pretending mock horror. &ldquo;Stevuns dear,
don&rsquo;t mind my not going! Plans are plans, you must
learn to understand. And I&rsquo;ll send her a lovely black
waist and a plum pudding for her Christmas. Tell
her I was laid up with one of my bad heads....
No? You won&rsquo;t let me fib? Horrid old thing&ndash;&ndash;come
and kiss me!... Ah, you never refuse to
kiss me, nice cave man with bad manners and muddy
shoes, wanting to thump his strong dear fists on my
little Chippendale tables&ndash;&ndash;and grow so good and
booky all in an instant. Forgets he was ever a bad
pirate and robbed everyone until he could buy his
Gorgeous Girl. Good-bye, story-book man, don&rsquo;t let
the old funeral frazzle you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve left the house, undecided whether he was
taking things too seriously and ought to apologize for
being rude to Beatrice or whether his intuitive impression
was correct&ndash;&ndash;that Beatrice was not the sort
of person he had imagined but that he, per se, was to
blame in the matter.</p>
<p>Steve chose to take a street car to the Faithful
house. He shrank from creating the atmosphere of a
generous and overbearing magnate whose chauffeur
opened the door of his machine and waited for him to
step majestically upon terra firma. He felt merely a
sympathetic friend, for some reason, as he walked the
three blocks from the street car through slush and ice,
and realized that Mary Faithful trudged back and
forth this same pathway twice a day.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly he met Mary at the door, rather
white faced and grayer of eyes than usual, but the
same sensible Mary who did not believe in any of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
customary agonies of grieving proper, as she afterward
told him. The old house had not assumed a
funereal air. There were flowers on the tables and
the cheery fire crackled in the grate, and even the
face of the dead woman seemed more content and
optimistic than it had ever been in life.</p>
<p>Steve was not expected to go to the cemetery so
he trudged back through the same slush to the street
car. A fish-market doorway proved a haven during
a long wait. He lounged idly against the doorway as
if he were an unemployed person casting about for
new fields of endeavour instead of the rushed young
Midas whose office phone was ringing incessantly.</p>
<p>He was thinking about Mary Faithful&rsquo;s pleasant
manner, the atmosphere of the old-fashioned house,
where there was no effort to be smart or gorgeous
or to conceal its shabbiness. He hoped Mary would
return to the office within the next few days. He
wanted her more than he wanted any one else, but
he told himself this was because he was selfish and
she was a capable machine. No, that was not it,
he decided a moment later as he looked in at the
activities of the fish market with passing interest.</p>
<p>Mary no longer seemed a mere machine but a remarkable
woman, a womanly woman, too. He liked
the old house with its atrocious horsehair sofa and
chair tidies and the Rogers group in the front bay
window. The fire had been so elemental and soothing,
so were the pots of flowers, the shabby piano,
and even more shabby books. One could rest there,
distributing whole flocks of newspapers where he
would. The death awe had not been permitted
to take a paramount place. How lucky Luke was,
to have such a sister.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>Mary was about Beatrice&rsquo;s age. At thirteen she
had begun to earn her own living. At thirteen
Beatrice had had a pony cart, a governess, a multitude
of frocks, her midwinter trip to New York,
where she saw all the musical comedies and gorged
on chocolates and pastry.</p>
<p>The upshot of it was that Steve decided to call on
Mary the following afternoon; it was only courtesy
he told himself by way of an excuse. He wanted to
talk to her&ndash;&ndash;not of business but of life, of the shabby
old house. Outwardly he wanted to ask if he might
help her and what her plans were, but in reality he
wanted her to help him. He no longer felt displeased
that Beatrice had not come with him; he felt positive
Mary would understand, that she would dismiss
Trudy&rsquo;s slight with proper scorn. Beatrice would
have insisted upon arriving in state. By this time
the bridge club with its Russian sweetmeats, its six-hundred-dollar
china plates, the new afternoon frock,
and the spoofing of Trudy must be well under way!</p>
<p>The fish market was not doing a land-office business.
Stray purchasers approached and halted before
the cashier&rsquo;s cage. Steve began watching them.
Suddenly he became aware of the gorgeous young
woman presiding behind the wire cage, reluctantly
pushing out change and accepting slips, completely
preoccupied in her own thoughts, while a copy of the
<i>High Blood Pressure Weekly</i> lay at one side. What
attracted Steve was the horrible similarity between
this young person and his own wife! Both had the
same fluffed, frizzled hair and a gay light chiffon
frock with gold trimmings. Though it was December
the toothpick point of a white-kid slipper
protruded from the cage. An imitation Egyptian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
necklace called attention to the thin, powdered
throat. The cashier was altogether a cheap copy of
Beatrice&rsquo;s general appearance. She had the same
tiny, nondescript features and indolent expression
in her eyes; she was most superior in her fashion of
dealing with the customers, never deigning to speak
or be spoken to. As soon as she spied Steve, however,
she smiled an invitation to enter and become
owner of half a whitefish or so.</p>
<p>Then the car came and he leaped aboard. It
seemed unbearable that a counterpart of Beatrice
O&rsquo;Valley was making change at Sullivan&rsquo;s Fish
Market&ndash;&ndash;but more unbearable to realize that women
in the position of Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley dressed and
rouged&ndash;&ndash;and acted very often&ndash;&ndash;in such a fashion
that women in the position of Trudy and this cashier
queen sought industriously to imitate them.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Luke showed his grief in the normal manner of any
half-grown, true-blue lad, singularly thoughtful of his
sister&rsquo;s wishes, and mentioning everyone and everything
except their mother and her death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t give up having a home,&rdquo; Mary told
him the night of the funeral; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll move into a
smaller place so I can take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll work pretty hard at school,&rdquo; was all he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will. I&rsquo;m proud of you now, and
if you work and show you deserve it I&rsquo;ll help you
through college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke shook his head. &ldquo;Takes too long before I
could get to earning real money. You ought to
have it easy pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my work. Besides, you will live your own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
life, and so you must grow up and love someone and
marry her. I can&rsquo;t depend on any one but myself,&rdquo;
she added, a little bitterly.</p>
<p>Luke stared into the fire. Perhaps this tousle-haired,
freckle-faced boy surmised his sister&rsquo;s love-story.
If so no one&ndash;&ndash;least of all his sister&ndash;&ndash;should
ever hear of the facts from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to get married. I want to make
a lot of money like Mr. O&rsquo;Valley did&ndash;&ndash;quick. Then
we&rsquo;ll go and live in Europe and maybe I&rsquo;ll get a
steam yacht and we&rsquo;ll hunt for buried treasure,&rdquo; he
could not refrain from adding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear. Just work hard for now and be
my pal; we&rsquo;ll let the future take care of itself. Another
thing&ndash;&ndash;we want to have as merry a Christmas
as if mother were with us. It&rsquo;s the only thing to do
or else we&rsquo;ll find ourselves morbid and unable to keep
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shamed tears were stoically refused entrance into
Luke&rsquo;s blue eyes. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll buy you a silver-backed
comb and brush. I got some extra money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Luke&ndash;&ndash;dear!&rdquo; Mary made the fatal error of
trying to hug him. He wriggled away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trudy never came near us,&rdquo; he said, sternly.</p>
<p>Mary was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. O&rsquo;Valley came like a regular&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to get to bed?&rdquo;
Mary changed the subject. &ldquo;Sleep in the room next
to mine if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you coming upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon. I want to look over the letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke rose and pretended a nonchalant stretching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to the office right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until New Year&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>Something in the tired way she spoke evoked
Luke&rsquo;s pity and sent him away to smother his boy-man&rsquo;s
grief by promises of a glorious future in which
his sister should live in the lap of luxury.</p>
<p>With its customary shock death had for the time
being given Mary a false estimate of her mother and
herself, the usual neurasthenic experience people undergo
at such a time. It seemed, as she sat alone
by the fire, that she must have been a strangely
selfish and ungrateful child who misunderstood,
neglected, and underestimated her mother, and she
would be forced to live with reproachful memories
the rest of her days. Each difference of opinion&ndash;&ndash;and
there had been little else&ndash;&ndash;which had risen between
them was magnified into brutal injustice on Mary&rsquo;s
part and righteous indignation on her mother&rsquo;s.
This state of mind would find a proper readjustment
in time but that did not comfort Mary at the present
moment. Her mother was dead, and when a mother
is gone so is the home unless someone bravely slips
into the absent one&rsquo;s place without delay and assumes
its responsibilities and credits. For Luke&rsquo;s
sake this was what Mary had resolved to do.</p>
<p>As she could not sleep she rummaged in a cabinet
containing old letters and mementos, which added
fuel to her self-reproach and misery. She had borne
up until now. Mary had always been the sort who
could meet a crisis. Reaction had set in and she felt
weak and faulty, longing for a strong shoulder upon
which to cry and be forgiven for her imagined shortcomings.
As she read yellowed letters of bygone
days and lives, finding the record of a baby sister
who had lived only a few days and of whom she had
been in ignorance, a scrap of her mother&rsquo;s wedding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
gown, old tintypes&ndash;&ndash;she realized that her family was
no more and that everyone needed a family, a group
of related persons whose interests, arguments, events,
and achievements are of particular benefit and importance
each to the other and who unconsciously
challenge the world, no matter what secret disagreements
there may be, to disrupt them if they
dare! Now only Luke and Mary comprised the
family.</p>
<p>After midnight Mary battled herself into the commonsense
attitude of going to bed. Wakening after
the dreamless sleep of the exhausted she found low
spirits and self-blame had somewhat diminished and
though her state of mind was as serious as her gray
eyes yet life was not utterly bereft of compensations.</p>
<p>Luke had thoughtfully risen early, clumsily tiptoeing
about to get breakfast. Neighbours had
furnished the customary donations of cake, pie, and
doughnuts, which gave Luke the opportunity of
spreading the breakfast table with these kingly
viands and doing justice to them in no half-hearted
fashion.</p>
<p>The sun streamed through the starched window
curtains, and even the empty rocking-chair seemed
serene in the relief from its morbid burden. Christmas
was only a few days away. Mary decided that they
should have a truly Christmas dinner, and that the
words she had bravely spoken as a three-year-old
runaway, found a mile from home and offered assistance
by kindly strangers, should become quite
true: &ldquo;Not anybody need take care of myself,&rdquo;
Mary had declared in dauntless fashion.</p>
<p>Later in the day Luke went to the office because
Mary thought it best. So when Steve called he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
found her alone, the same cheery fire burning in the
grate, the same posies blooming in their window pots,
and the smell of homemade bread pervading the
house, Mary in a soft gray frock presiding over the
walnut secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry not to be at the office,&rdquo; she began,
thinking he had come to persuade her to return.
&ldquo;Sit down. Well&ndash;&ndash;you see,&rdquo; indicating the stacks
of addressed envelopes&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t come back
until after the New Year. Do you mind? There is a
great deal to be seen to here, and I feel I&rsquo;ve earned
the right to loaf for a week. I want particularly to
make the holidays happy for Luke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do. Besides, you never had your
vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call this a vacation and I&rsquo;ll work extra hard
to prove to you that it was worth the granting.&rdquo;
Still she did not understand that he wanted to talk
to her for the very comfort of her companionship,
to enjoy the fire, the smell of homemade bread, the
atmosphere of shabby, lovely, everyday plain living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll decide that later. I came to see just&ndash;&ndash;you.
Surprised? I wanted to ask if there is anything
I can do for you. I want to help if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no exact plans. Just a definite idea of finding
a small apartment and making it as homey as
possible. I loathe apartments usually,&rdquo; she added,
impulsively, &ldquo;but we must have a home and I can&rsquo;t
assume a whole house. We will take our old things
and fix them over, and the worst of them we&rsquo;ll pass
on to someone needing them badly enough not to
mind what they are.&rdquo; She was quite frank in admitting
the tortured walnut and the engravings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are not going to break up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
board&ndash;&ndash;though it&rsquo;s none of my business. I brought
some fruit. Do you mind?&rdquo; He had been trying
to hide behind the chair a mammoth basket of fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. How lovely of you and Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not possible for Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley to come
yesterday,&rdquo; he forced himself to say. &ldquo;She was very
sorry and is going to call on you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Mary answered, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a nice old place here. Mind if I stroll
about and stare? I have very seldom been in rooms
like this one. An orphan asylum, a ranch, a hall
bedroom, star boarder, a club, a better club, the
young palace&ndash;&ndash;is my record. How different you
seem in your home, Miss Faithful. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the
dress. I like soft gray&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he caught himself in
time.</p>
<p>Mary was blushing. She called his attention to
some wood carving her father had done. Presently
Steve changed the subject back to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d like a slice of homemade
bread,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Must I turn up my coat collar
and go stand at the side door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made it because Luke had eaten nothing but pie
and cake. You really don&rsquo;t want just bread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&ndash;&ndash;two slices, thick, stepmother size, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed quite unreal to Mary as she was finally
prevailed upon to bring in the tea wagon with the
bread and jam trimmings to accompany the steaming
little kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man alive,&rdquo; sighed Steve, stretching out leisurely,
&ldquo;I came to console you and I&rsquo;m being consoled
and fed&ndash;&ndash;in body and mind&ndash;&ndash;made fit for
work.... I say, what do you think of letting
the Boston merger be made public at the banquet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
on&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He began a budget of business detail
upon which Mary commented, agreeing or objecting
as she felt inclined.</p>
<p>It was so easy to become clear-headed about
work&ndash;&ndash;details became adjusted with magical speed&ndash;&ndash;when
one had a gray-eyed girl with a tilted freckled
nose sitting opposite. The soft gray dress played
a prominent part, too, even if the Gorgeous Girl would
have been amused at its style and material. Besides
this, there was the wood fire, the easy-chair with gay
Turkey-red cushions designed for use and not admiration,
and no yapping spaniel getting tangled up
in one&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<p>Before they realized it twilight arrived, and simultaneously
they began to be self-conscious and formal,
telling themselves that this would never do, no,
indeed! Dear me, what queer things do happen all
in a day! Still, it would always be a splendid thing
to remember.</p>
<p>Certainly it was more edifying than to confront a
nervous Gorgeous Girl who had discovered that her
maid had been reading her personal notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sprinkled talcum powder on them and the powder
is all smudged away, so Jody has been spying.
She is packing her things now and I shall refuse any
references. But who will ever take such good care
of me, Steve? And please get dressed; we are invited
to the Marcus Baynes for dinner. They have a
wonderful poet from Greenwich Village who is spending
the holidays with them&ndash;&ndash;long hair, green-velvet
jacket, cigar-box ukulele, and all. A darling! And
I am going to take Monster because he does black-and-white
sketches and I want one of my ittey, bittey
dirl.&rdquo; And so on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>Certainly it was more pleasing than to have a
shamed and confused Trudy elegantly attired come
dashing in with a jar of vanishing cream as a peace
offering, presumably to smooth out any wrinkles
of grief, and to explain hastily that it looked like a
lack of feeling not to be at the funeral but most certainly
it was not&ndash;&ndash;no, indeed; it was just tending to
business. She was sure Mary realized how essential
it was not to offend the Gorgeous Girl. How dreadful
it was for poor Mary. She, Trudy, had cried her
old eyes out thinking about it. Did Mary get the
flowers she and Gay sent? She wished she could do
something nice for Mary. How would she like to have
a black-satin dress made at cost price? No? She
wasn&rsquo;t going to wear mourning! Well, it was very
brave but it would certainly look queer and cause
talk.... Gay&rsquo;s moustache was coming on
beautifully and no one at the bridge club had dared
to spoof her!</p>
<p>At least there was some excuse for the delivery on
Christmas Day of a parcel addressed to Miss Mary
Faithful. It contained Steve&rsquo;s card, some wonderful
new books with an ivory paper knife slipped between
them. And when Mary wrote to thank him she
found herself inclosing a demure new silver dime,
explaining:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must give you a coin because you gave me a
knife, and unless I did so the old superstition might
come true&ndash;&ndash;and cut our &lsquo;business affections&rsquo; right
straight in two!&rdquo;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IX' id='CHAPTER_IX'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Mary returned to the office with a premeditatedly
formal air toward Steve. She had
taken a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to refrain
from letting an impulsive expression of sympathy
assume false meanings in her heart. On the other
hand, Steve felt a boor for having sent the books. He
was so used to being called cave man and told not to
do this or say that that he now pictured himself an
awkward villain who had best confine himself to writing
checks and growling at the business world.</p>
<p>He almost dreaded seeing Mary lest she show she
considered the gift improper despite her delightful
little note of thanks. This demeanour, however, was
of short duration. They became their real selves
before the morning passed, the medium being the
question of keeping John Gager, an old clerk pressed
into service during the war period and now superfluous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to let him go?&rdquo; Mary reproached
Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so; he&rsquo;s a doddering nuisance they tell
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s old and he has always served so faithfully.
I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to send him away now.
He does do what is expected of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s vacation had somewhat dimmed her business
sagacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose; but we&rsquo;ll be doddering idiots some day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
too. No one will keep us. No one can expect to be
carried along indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I have ever asked you to do
such a thing,&rdquo; she insisted, fearlessly. &ldquo;To see him
trying to act as fit as twenty-five, wearing juvenile
shirts and ties, struggling to be brisk, slangy, to oblige
everyone and step along, you know. Oh, don&rsquo;t turn
him away just yet; he is honest and he tries. I can&rsquo;t
tell him, and can&rsquo;t you see his old face quiver when
he opens his envelope and finds the dismissal slip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s resolutions faded like mist before the sun.
He found himself saying: &ldquo;You ought to be a little
sister to the poor. I guess we&rsquo;ll keep Gager for a
while. He doesn&rsquo;t smoke cigarettes all day and try
to lie about it. How did you like those books?&rdquo;
he added, boyishly.</p>
<p>Mary laid a finger on her lips. &ldquo;Sh-h-h. It&rsquo;s
business. But I did like them&ndash;&ndash;so would you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d read them if I had an easy-chair and some
homemade bread and tea. Do you know what I
had to do for my Christmas Day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d rather not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell someone, and ask if I&rsquo;m all wrong
about it,&rdquo; he said, half humorously, half in earnest.
&ldquo;I told my father-in-law in part and it struck him
as a huge joke. He purpled with laughing and said:
&lsquo;Gad, she&rsquo;ll always have her way!&rsquo;&rdquo; Steve was
thinking out loud. He was realizing that Constantine
was not even conscious he had raised his daughter
to be a rebel doll and he, apparently an honourable
citizen, encouraged and upheld her in her
doctrine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you have to do?&rdquo; Mary asked in
spite of herself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I had to officiate at Monster&rsquo;s Christmas tree,
which was in the boudoir, laden with the treasures
of the four corners. I presented a diamond-studded
gold purse and a sable cape to my wife and received
a diamond-studded cigar knife&ndash;&ndash;I have two others&ndash;&ndash;and
a mink-lined coat in return. I was dragged to a
half-dozen different houses to deliver presents and
collect the same, and witness the tragedy of Bea&rsquo;s
receiving a vanity case she had given someone else
two years before and which had evidently been going
the rounds. It was a bit disconcerting to have it
turn up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a ponderous seven-course dinner at Mr.
Constantine&rsquo;s, during which I had to kiss Aunt Belle
under the mistletoe and pretend to be elated, hear
several yards of grand opera torn off on the new
talking machine in its nine-hundred-dollar Chinese
case, take my father-in-law to the club, return to
find Trudy and Gay having a Yuletide word with my
wife. Trudy brought a concoction of purple chiffon,
jet beads, and exploded hen which was entitled a
breakfast jacket, and in return she drew down a
pair of silver candlesticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that we dressed in all our grandeur for the
fancy-dress ball at Colonel Tatlock&rsquo;s, Beatrice as
Juliet and I as the young and dashing Romeo!
Shivering in our finery we drove to the Tatlock&rsquo;s
to make fools of ourselves until three A. M. and
shiver home again with aching heads and a handful
of damaged cotillion favours. About the same
sort of thing happened on New Year&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He
laughed, but it was not a pleasant sound, inviting
a response.</p>
<p>Beatrice dashed in, to Mary&rsquo;s relief, to bestow&ndash;&ndash;over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
a week late&ndash;&ndash;a Christmas present of perfume
and a black-silk waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Valley has explained how rushed I have
been with my classes,&rdquo; she began, prettily, &ldquo;but I
have thought of you in all your sorrow. I lost my
dear mother when I was too young to remember her,
still it means a bond between us.... Oh, you
are not wearing black? Dear me, that&rsquo;s too bad....
Well, you may have to go to somebody&rsquo;s
funeral where you feel you want to wear it&ndash;&ndash;a black
waist is always useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She managed to carry Steve off to look at a set of
pink glass sherbet cups she was to give her father for
his birthday, and Mary was conscious of a certain
pity for the Gorgeous Girl&ndash;&ndash;prompted not so much by
her present state of affairs as her inevitable future.</p>
<p>The last of January Steve was called away on a
business trip through the Middle West. Beatrice
had no desire to go with him; she said she simply
could not conceive of having a good time in Indiana
and Illinois, and what was the sense in bearing with
him in his misery? But she was quite willing Steve
should stay away as long as he was needed by business
entanglements. In fact, Beatrice now betrayed
a certain driving quality in trying to make him feel
that as their honeymoon was ended and everyone
had entertained for them it was high time Steve must
retire from social life to a degree, and outdo her own
father in the making of a vast fortune. She seldom
begged him to ride with her or come home to luncheon
to fritter away the best part of the afternoon in a
pursuit of silver-pheasant ornaments for the dinner
table. That phase of her selfishness was at an end.
It was when Steve demanded the luxury of merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
staying at home with no chattering peacocks of
women and asinine, half-tipsy men playing with
each other until early morning that Beatrice refused
her consent.</p>
<p>She did not wish any personal domestic life, Steve
decided after several experiences along these lines.
She could not see the pleasure in a Sunday afternoon
hike; walking to see a sunset was absurd! All very
well to be whisked by at twenty miles an hour and give
a careless nod at the setting golden sphere, but to
trudge through wintry roads and up an icy hill and
stand, frozen and fagged, weighted down by sweaters,
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Dear me, Steve really needed to see a doctor!
Perhaps he had better start to play golf with papa!</p>
<p>Meals t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te caused her spirits to droop, and
she soon fell into the habit of waiting until Steve was
away or having her luncheon in her room. She was
seldom up for breakfast, and when he protested
against this hotel-like custom she would say: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t expect you to appreciate my viewpoint and
my wishes, but at least be well-bred enough to tolerate
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was on the point of reminding her that his viewpoint
and wishes were treated only with argument
and ridicule&ndash;&ndash;but as usual he refrained. Silence
on the part of one who knows he is in the right yet
chooses apparently to yield the point in question is
a significant milestone on the road of separation.
An argument with Beatrice meant one of two outcomes:
A violent scene of temper and overwrought
nerves with tears as the conquering slacker&rsquo;s weapon
or a long, sulky period of tenseness which made him
take refuge in his office and his club.</p>
<p>He wondered sometimes how it was he had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
before realized the true worth of his wife, how he had
been so madly infatuated and adoring of her slightest
whim during the years of earning his fortune and the
brief period of their formal engagement. Almost
reluctantly the an&aelig;sthesia of unreality and distorted
values was disappearing, leaving Steve with but one
conclusion: That it had been his own conceited fault,
and therefore he deserved scant pity from either himself
or the world at large.</p>
<p>Mark Constantine, whose activities lessened each
month, due to ill health, began prowling about
Steve&rsquo;s office at unexpected hours, cornering him
for prosy talks and conferences, under which Steve
writhed in helpless surrender. Since he realized
the true meaning of his marriage he began placing the
blame on the culprit&ndash;&ndash;Beatrice&rsquo;s father. As he did
so he wondered if it was possible that Constantine
did not realize the havoc he had wrought. His
wealth and Steve&rsquo;s speedily accumulated fortune
via hides and government razors suddenly seemed
stupid, inane; and he no longer felt a sense of pride
at what he had accomplished. He never wanted to
hear details of Constantine&rsquo;s more gradual and bitter
rise in the world; there was certain to be slimy spots
of which Steve in his new frame of mind could no
longer approve. He was weary of hearing about
money, just as his good sense caused him to be weary
of socialistic prattling and absurd pleas for Bolshevism.
It seemed to him that the dollar standard
was the paramount means both magnate and socialist
used to value inanimate and animate objects. He
longed for a new unit of measure.</p>
<p>He was keen on business trips. At least he could
have the freedom of his hotel and could roam about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
without being pointed out as the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s
husband, the lucky young dog and so on. Neither
would he be dragged from this house to that to sit
on impossible futurist chairs while young things of
thirty-nine clad in belladonna plasters and jet sequins
gathered about to tell him what perfectly wonderful
times their class in cosmic consciousness was having.</p>
<p>Mary Faithful was keen to have him go. She
dreaded any furthering of the personal understanding
between them. When one has become master of a
heartache and thoroughly demonstrated that mastery
it is not sensible to let it verge toward a heart
throb, even if one is positive of the ability to change
it back at will into the hopeless ache. It is like unhandcuffing
a prisoner and saying: &ldquo;Sprint a bit,
I can catch up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Beatrice had any number of
activities to take up her time. Her period of being
a romantic parasite&ndash;&ndash;the world called it a sweet
bride&ndash;&ndash;was ended. She was now bent on becoming
as mad and ruthless a butterfly as there ever was,
and to the accomplishment of her aim she did not
purpose to stint herself in any way. She still drew
her own allowance from her father and accepted
extra checks for extra things necessary for her welfare
and popularity.</p>
<p>More than once Steve counted the monthly expenditures,
with the same result&ndash;&ndash;Beatrice was living
on her father&rsquo;s income quite as much as on his own.
Her position was not unlike that of people who say
to their prosperous neighbours possessing a motor
car: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll furnish the lunch and the gasolene, and
you take us to the picnic grounds!&rdquo; Constantine
still owned the figurative motor car, or the substantial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
end of Beatrice&rsquo;s expenses, while Steve furnished
the lunch and the gasolene, trying to delude himself
that he was supporting his wife. Beatrice&rsquo;s clothes
were beyond his income, for he was not yet a millionaire.
Neither could he afford the affairs which she
gave, with favours of jewellery; nor the trips here and
there in private cars.</p>
<p>Furnishing the lunch and gasolene and perhaps
a possible tire or so does not give one the sense of
ownership that having the motor car gives; nor was
it Steve&rsquo;s notion of being the possessor of a home.
He spoke to Beatrice about it, only to be kissed affectionately
and scolded prettily by way of answer;
or else to have those eternal omnipresent tears reproach
him for being cross &ldquo;when papa wants me to
have things and he has no one else in the world to
spend all his money on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few attempts he gave it up but resolved
to make his fortune equal to his father-in-law&rsquo;s, as
Beatrice wished. He saw no other way out of the
situation. To do so in his present interests was impossible&ndash;&ndash;he
had fancied that half a million was a
fair sum to offer a Gorgeous Girl&ndash;&ndash;but he saw it was
only a nibble at the line. He must outdo Constantine.
He cast about for some unsuspected fields
of effort, this time to strike out into work of which
Constantine was ignorant. He began to resent the
fact that after his lucky strike on the exchange he
had played copy cat and gone mincing into the hide-and-leather
business, using Constantine&rsquo;s good will
as his stepping stone. The same was true of the
stock bought in the razor factory; he had merely
paid for the stock; he did not know the steps of progress
necessary to the business.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>This time he would prove his own merit, he would
not take Constantine into his confidence. Unknown
to any one save Mary, Steve selected a new-style
talking machine to promote. He knew as much
about talking machines as Beatrice knew about
cooking a square meal. But Steve had lost his clear-headedness
and he thought, as do most get-rich-quick
men, that, possessed of the Midas touch, he could
come in contact with nothing but gold.</p>
<p>He began backing the inventor and looking round
for a factory site. He sought it away from Hanover,
for he wanted it to be a complete surprise. He begrudged
his father-in-law&rsquo;s knowing anything of it.
He went into the enterprise rather heavily&ndash;&ndash;but it
did not worry him, for he was quite sure he possessed
the luck eternal, and he must support his own wife.
Side speculating was the only way he thought it
possible to do so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beatrice found Trudy to be both a
good foil and a dangerous enemy, one who was not
to be ridiculed or set aside. Trudy had never stopped
working since the day Beatrice climbed the rear
stairs of the Graystone and had been bullied into
buying the vanishing cream. Beatrice scarcely
knew the various steps which Trudy had climbed in
a figurative sense, dragging Gay after her, grumbling
and sneering but quite willing to be dragged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, aunty,&rdquo; she explained one stormy
February afternoon while they were having a permanent
wave put in their hair, &ldquo;Trudy is so obliging
and useful, and I&rsquo;m sorry for her. She tries to do so
many nice things for me that I never have a chance
to become offended. I&rsquo;ve tried! But she just won&rsquo;t
break away. And I like to tease Steve by knowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
her, Steve is such a bear when he doesn&rsquo;t like people.
Rude is a mild term. He particularly hates Gay.
Now Gay is quite a dear and he always played nicely
with me. I should hate to lose him&ndash;&ndash;so how can I
offend his wife; particularly when she takes so well
with older men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Belle sniffed. &ldquo;Men old enough to be her
father&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d think they would appreciate mellowed
love instead of a selfish little chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beauty doctor, who had spent the greater
share of the day at the Constantine house, suppressed
a smile and stored up the remark for her next customer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Beatrice murmured as she
consulted a hand glass. &ldquo;I am beginning to wish
I had married a man about papa&rsquo;s age. It would
have been much jollier in some ways. Steve is so
strenuous and rude. A cave man is fun to be engaged
to and keep a record about in your chapbook&ndash;&ndash;but
when you marry him it is a different
matter. I remember how thrilled and enthusiastic
about Steve I used to be when he was working for
papa and living in a hall bedroom. I knew he adored
me yet had to keep his place, and I used to dream
about him and wonder if he really would keep his
word and make a fortune so he could marry me. But
now he has done it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too disappointed. Elderly men
usually have wheel chairs and diets after a little,
and you&rsquo;d feel it your duty to play nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s far better to be disappointed in one&rsquo;s
husband than one&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; Beatrice agreed. &ldquo;I
know that. For you can manage to see very little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
of your husband; but your friends&ndash;&ndash;deary me, they
your very existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Trudy ever mention the days she worked
in Steve&rsquo;s office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Clever little thing, she knows enough to
admit it prettily every now and then, so there is
nothing to badger her about. She has even trained
Gay to talk of it occasionally. She has done wonders
for him; one of the clubmen is backing him to go into
the interior-decorating business. Of course he will
make good because everyone will feel morally obliged
to go there. So the Vondeplosshes on the strength
of this have moved to the Touraine, a different sort
of apartment house, I assure you. They are entertaining,
if you please; everyone asks them everywhere.
Gay is painting garlands of old-fashioned flowers in
panels for Jill&rsquo;s boudoir. I think I&rsquo;ll have the same
thing done in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay is painting them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Some limp artist who could never get
the commission for himself. Gay stands about in a
natty blue-serge effect and takes the credit and the
check. What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;turning to the beauty doctor.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as dull as the Dead Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Flinks informed them of a labour revolt in
the West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid creatures, always wanting more! Well,
they won&rsquo;t get it. I think Steve is ridiculous with
his banquets and bonuses and all, and upon my word,
Mary Faithful has as good an Oriental rug in her
office as I have in my house. Tell us something
really important, Miss Flinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retrieving her error the beauty doctor whispered
a scandal concerning the newly married Teddy Markhams,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
who had had such a violent quarrel the week
before that Mrs. Teddy had pushed the piano halfway
out the window and police had rushed to the
scene thinking it might be another bomb explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ripping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice was all animation, and she gave Miss
Flinks no peace until she learned all the details, and
the rumour about the actress who had rented an
expensive town house for the season and a d&eacute;butante
who was being rushed to a retreat to prevent her
marriage to a gypsy violinist who had already taught
her the drug habit.</p>
<p>Trudy telephoned the latter part of the afternoon,
and as it was a gray, blowy day with nothing special
to do to revive one&rsquo;s spirits Beatrice urged her to
come in for tea&ndash;&ndash;tea to be cocktails and buttered
toast.</p>
<p>Within a few moments she appeared&ndash;&ndash;a symphony
of blonde broadcloth set in black furs, very charming
and chic, and so solicitous about Aunt Belle&rsquo;s recently
removed mole and the scar left by the electric needle,
and so admiring of the two newly beautified ladies
that they were quite won in spite of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you near here when you telephoned?&rdquo;
Beatrice asked, curiously. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t ten minutes
getting here and you look as spick and span as if
you had stepped out of a bandbox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look outside and you&rsquo;ll see that Gay and I have
had a true case of auto-intoxication!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the window there proved to be a smart,
selfish roadster, battleship-gray with vivid scarlet
trimmings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Beatrice said in astonishment. At this
identical moment she began to envy Trudy. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
really ashamed of the fact, nor did she understand
why she should envy this bankrupt yet progressive
little nobody in her homemade bargain-remnant
costume. The reason was that Beatrice&rsquo;s latent
abilities longed to be doing something, achieving
something, capturing, inventing, destroying, earning
if need be&ndash;&ndash;but doing something. The daughter of
Mark and Hannah Constantine could not help but
have the germ of great ability within her, sluggish
and spoiled as it might be; and it must perforce duly
manifest itself from time to time. Beatrice realized
that Trudy felt a greater joy and satisfaction in displaying
this not-paid-for cheap machine&ndash;&ndash;having
sat up half the night to make the shirred curtains&ndash;&ndash;than
Beatrice ever could feel in her tapestry-lined,
orchid-adorned limousine. So she began to envy
Trudy just as Trudy envied her. Trudy had done
nothing but struggle to be able to live, as she termed
it; Beatrice had never been allowed to struggle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe for all but the left back tire,&rdquo; Trudy
said before any one had the chance to hint of the fact;
&ldquo;but Gay has to have it for his new business, and it
is such a joy! I hope you approve, Beatrice. And
what a darling gown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing left for Beatrice but to order
the cocktails and toast, and for Aunt Belle to agree
smilingly with Trudy&rsquo;s clever suggestions.</p>
<p>Trudy never came to see Beatrice unless she gained
some material point or had one in view, and the point
she had come to gain this afternoon was of no small
importance. In her own fashion she managed to
inform her hostess that Gay had received an order
from&ndash;&ndash;well, it was a tremendous secret and he would
be terribly cross if he knew she told even her dearest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
Bea and her sweet Aunt Belle, but she just couldn&rsquo;t
help it&ndash;&ndash;he had an order from Alice Twill, who
thought she was going to beat everyone in town to
the greatest sensation of the year: To have the barn
of a Twill mansion remodelled, decorated and so on,
from coal bin to cupola, until it was an exact copy
of a French palace&ndash;&ndash;she really forgot just which one.
... Yes, Alice&rsquo;s aunt in Australia had died and
left her everything; Alice said she was not going to
wait until she was on crutches before she spent it.
Gay was simply out of his head trying to plan the
thing and Alice was to move to a hotel for several
weeks until a newly furnished wing was ready to be
inhabited.</p>
<p>There was no reason why New York persons should
have their homes like palaces and ch&acirc;teaux and so
on, and turn their noses up at upstate residences.
Alice was going to show them. And&ndash;&ndash;this very subtly&ndash;&ndash;Gay
had said that if only Beatrice could have
the authority to redecorate her father&rsquo;s home into an
Italian villa Alice Twill would be the loser when
comparisons were made&ndash;&ndash;since the Constantine
house had twice the possibilities and so on, and Beatrice
twice the taste. And what an achievement it
would be; a distinct civic improvement!...
Yes, Gay was working with the best firms in New
York, and there was no doubt of his success in the
enterprise.</p>
<p>Before she left, Trudy had almost secured Beatrice&rsquo;s
promise that the Constantine house should be
made into an Italian villa and that, if she so decided,
Gay should have the commission. There was a
place at Frascati she had always admired, and they
could use some ideas from a show place in Florida.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>Had Trafalgar terminated differently Napoleon
would have been no more surprised or jubilant than
Trudy, who fairly skidded home to the new and more
pretentious apartment, where she found Gay in one
of his sneering, sulky moods and quite angry to think
Trudy was carrying the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know Alice Twill will really come
across?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;And I suppose you&rsquo;ve got the
machine covered with mud, too. Anyway, what do
I know about decorating? I work on my reputation
and everyone&rsquo;s sympathies and I&rsquo;m in fear all the
time some real decorator will turn up and show my
hand or else refuse to work under me and split commissions.
You&rsquo;re too damned optimistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t optimistic where would we be?
Starving,&rdquo; she said with no attempt at politeness.
Common courtesies between them had long since
been dispensed with. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten you nearly everything
you have, and if you&rsquo;ll do as I say I&rsquo;ll go right
on getting things for you. But you&rsquo;re lazy and jealous&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a sneering little laugh. &ldquo;Why, you poor
nobody, people only tolerate you because of me.
They roar behind your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they? They pity me because I&rsquo;m married
to such a weak fish! Men are nice to you because
of me&ndash;&ndash;and there isn&rsquo;t a woman I&rsquo;ve met that I
have not made afraid of me. Beatrice hasn&rsquo;t the will
power of a slug; you can hand her flattery in chunks
as big as boulders and she swallows them without
choking. It&rsquo;s her husband who sees through us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&ndash;&ndash;the goat tender? Oh, beg pardon&ndash;&ndash;treading
on someone else&rsquo;s toes. Or didn&rsquo;t they have
goats in Michigan?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never hang together another year,&rdquo; she
said, recklessly. &ldquo;The first chance I have to exchange
you for a real man your day is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think any one else would marry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think. I just go ahead grabbing everything
I can, and when a person has to grab for someone
else as well as herself it keeps them moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a crude and impossible little fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without warning Trudy&rsquo;s hand shot out, and on
Gay&rsquo;s cheek rested a red mark for the greater part
of the evening.</p>
<p>A half hour later he was trying to apologize, having
bucked himself up to it with brandy, in order to borrow
enough money to play pool with that same evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>After Gay left, Trudy put on her things
and trudged over to Mary&rsquo;s house. Gay
had driven off in the car and she was glad
he had. Like Steve the day of the funeral, she did
not wish to drive but to have the nervous outlet of
walking.</p>
<p>Trudy was seldom angry. But when she found
Mary in the old library, the same true-blue, good-looking
thing with just a little coldness of manner
as Trudy tried to enthuse over her, Trudy felt
ashamed. And she was angry far more often than
she was ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Luke?&rdquo; she asked, taking off her things
and lying down wearily on the sofa. &ldquo;Oh, Mary
mine, you don&rsquo;t know how good it is to be here again,
to be able to talk&ndash;&ndash;really talk to someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke is at basketball&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Mary began, stopping
as she discovered that Trudy was in tears.
&ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo; as Trudy sobbed the harsh,
long sobs of a tormented and frail mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to hate me&ndash;&ndash;selfish, insincere hypocrite&ndash;&ndash;cheat&ndash;&ndash;liar.
Oh, I hate myself! I hate him,
and Bea, and all of them! They aren&rsquo;t worth your
blessed little finger. Mary, Mary, please stay quite
contrary and never change. Never get to be a Gorgeous
Girl, will you? ... Nerves, I suppose;
and I haven&rsquo;t had the right things to eat.&rdquo; She
sat up and began smoothing her injured flounces.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so thin, and there are funny lilac shadows
under your eyes. You can&rsquo;t live on nerve energy
forever. And I know your delicatessen suppers or
else the rich orgies to which you are invited&ndash;&ndash;not
enough sleep&ndash;&ndash;and always that eternal upstage
pose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay wears on me; he is growing strong, with
never an ache or pain. I never used to have them
but I&rsquo;m all unnerved and weak. He hates me, Mary.
Yes, he does.&rdquo; She began a detailed recital of woes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave him?&rdquo; Mary asked as there came
a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without any one else to marry?&rdquo; Trudy&rsquo;s eyes
were wide open in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you have someone waiting to pay your
board bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go to work again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you worked rather hard right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m working to have a good
time. And I&rsquo;m a wonder; everyone says so. The
clubmen are so nice to me. Beatrice has done a
great deal, even if Steve hates us and acts as if we
were poison.... He isn&rsquo;t happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary knew she was flushing. &ldquo;Tell me some more
about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Trudy was not to be swerved from the other
topic. &ldquo;Beatrice makes fun of him and she flirts
shamefully. She has half a dozen flames all the time.
One was a common cabaret singer; she had him for
tea when Steve wasn&rsquo;t there. Now she is tired of
him. You see, she had to have someone to take
Gay&rsquo;s place! I don&rsquo;t think Steve flirts with any one;
he isn&rsquo;t that sort. He&rsquo;s so intense he will break his
heart in the old-fashioned way and then go and be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
socialist or something dreadful. They scarcely see
each other, and of course Beatrice&rsquo;s father thinks
everything is lovely and they are both perfection.
He just can&rsquo;t see the truth. Steve is a cave man and
Beatrice is a butterfly&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m a fraud&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re
just an old dear!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a fraud,&rdquo; she said, with sudden honesty.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t come to see you unless I wanted something.
I want to talk to you with all barriers down.
I wish you had ever done some terrible thing or were
unhappy. I don&rsquo;t know why, Mary dear; it&rsquo;s not as
horrid as it sounds. I think it&rsquo;s because I want to
know the real soul of you, and if you showed me how
you met troubles and trials, you being so good, I&rsquo;d be
the better woman for it in meeting my problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was truly a tired, oldish Trudy speaking. In
the last sentence Trudy had touched the greatest
depths of which she was capable&ndash;&ndash;causing Mary to
hint of her one deep secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re growing up, that&rsquo;s all. And I&rsquo;m not
good&ndash;&ndash;not a bit good. Why, Trudy, do you know
I have had to fight hard&ndash;&ndash;terribly hard about something?
I&rsquo;ve never told any one before. I can&rsquo;t
really tell what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over what? You saint in white blouses and
crisp ties, always smiling and working and helping
people! How have you battled? Tell me, tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary came over to the sofa and sat beside Trudy,
holding the white, cold hands laden with foolish rings.
&ldquo;I loved and do love someone very much who never
did and never will love me. I must be near that
person daily, be useful to him, earn my own living
by so doing&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;ve made myself be content of
heart in spite of it and not live on starved hopes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
and jealous dreams.... You see, I&rsquo;m quite
human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy drew her hands away. She had caused
Mary to confirm her suspicions, and she was sorry
she had done so. The better part of her knew that
she had been admitted into the very sanctuary of the
girl&rsquo;s soul, and that the worst part of her, which
usually dominated, was not worthy to be trusted
with such a secret. She wished Mary had not said
the words&ndash;&ndash;since it changed everything and made a
singularly pleasing weapon to use against Beatrice
O&rsquo;Valley should occasion rise. Mary was good&ndash;&ndash;and
it was safer to slander a good person than a bad
one because there was less chance of a come-back.
As she tried to make herself forget what she had just
heard she knew that in the heat of anger or to gain
some material goal she would use this effectual
weapon without thinking and without remorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor girl!&rdquo; was all she said; and Mary, believing
that Trudy so reverenced her secret that she
was not going to stab it with clumsy words, kissed
her and very practically set about getting a lunch.</p>
<p>Trudy went home taking some biscuit and half a
cake with her, and by the time she reached the Touraine
she was in a cheerful frame of mind once more.
The relief of confession, the home food, and the knowledge
of Mary&rsquo;s secret had buoyed her up past caring
for or considering Gay.</p>
<p>To her surprise Gay was at home, jubilant and
repentant. He had won at pool and had also consumed
some 1879 Burgundy, which conspired to
make him adore his red-haired wife and tell her that
he had quite deserved and enjoyed having his face
smacked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>The pool money in her safe keeping, visions of a
new hat to wear at the next luncheon caused Trudy
to equal his elation. Together they ate up Mary&rsquo;s
biscuits and cake and talked about Beatrice&rsquo;s remodelling
the Constantine mansion at the cost of
many thousands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could almost retire,&rdquo; Trudy suggested; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m afraid Steve will never give his consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Bea would never let a little thing
like a husband stand in the way of her progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In March, just as Steve was returning, Beatrice
and her aunt departed for a whirl in Florida, with a
laconic invitation that Steve and his father-in-law
follow them. Steve declined the invitation with
alarming curtness.</p>
<p>Though Constantine worried in his peculiar way
because Steve did not rush down to Florida to play
with the rest of the snapping turtles Beatrice had
about her heels he did not succeed in getting anything
but a logical explanation as to a business rush from
his son-in-law. More and more Steve was being
saddled with Constantine&rsquo;s end of the game as well
as his own&ndash;&ndash;and he did not know how to proceed with
the double responsibility. So Constantine went to
Florida alone, to find his daughter revelling in new
frocks and flirtations, both of which she temporarily
sidetracked while she made her father give his consent
to having the house done over after the manner of
a Frascati villa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; commented her father, during the heat
of the argument, &ldquo;I thought you were pretty well
off as you were. Will Steve like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care what I do,&rdquo; she hastened to
assure him. &ldquo;Of course he will&ndash;&ndash;he ought to&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
paying for it. He&rsquo;ll have as wonderful a home as
there is in the United States. Alice&rsquo;s will be a caricature
by contrast. Gay says so. As soon as we go
home I&rsquo;m going to signal them to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t touch my room or I&rsquo;ll burn down the
whole plant,&rdquo; her father warned. &ldquo;And if I were
you I&rsquo;d tell Steve first&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s only right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my money,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know&ndash;&ndash;but you could pretend to consult
him. Your mother and I never bought a toothpick
that we hadn&rsquo;t agreed on beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old papa.&rdquo; She kissed him graciously by
way of dismissal.</p>
<p>So Steve received the letter announcing the plans
a few days later. It was a semi-patronizing, semi-affectionate
letter with a great many underlined
words and superlative adjectives and intended to
convey the impression that he was a mighty lucky
chap to have married a fairy princess who would
spend her ducats in rigging up an uncomfortable
moth-eaten villa of the days of kingdom come.</p>
<p>As he finished it Gay appeared, having received
a letter telling him to hurry ahead with the plans
and contracts. Gay was rather obsequious in his
manner since he did not know whether it was Steve
or Beatrice who was to pay for this transformation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my wife insists, go ahead&ndash;&ndash;but don&rsquo;t move your
arts-and-crafts shop into my office. I&rsquo;m not enough
interested to see designs and so on. I never had
time to be one of the leisure class, and I&rsquo;m too old to be
kidded into thinking I&rsquo;m one of them now. But I
did make a mistake,&rdquo; he added, slowly, whether for
Gay&rsquo;s benefit or not no one could tell&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I thought
the world owed me more than a living&ndash;&ndash;that it owed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
me a bargain. And there never was a bargain
cheaply won that didn&rsquo;t prove a white elephant in
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay&rsquo;s one-cylinder brain did not follow the intricacies
of the statement. He merely thought of
Steve in more than usually profane terms&ndash;&ndash;and concluded
that Beatrice was paying the bill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>It was April before Steve found himself visiting
with Mary Faithful again and admiring as heartily
as Luke had admired the new apartment Mary
had chosen for her family.</p>
<p>It had, to Steve&rsquo;s mind, the same delightful air
of freedom and attractive shabbiness that he had
come to consider as essential for a true home. While
Beatrice was launched on her new object in life&ndash;&ndash;making
the house into a villa, from upholstering a
gondola in sky-blue satin and expecting people to use
it as a sofa to having the walls frescoed with fat,
pouting cherubs&ndash;&ndash;Mary had selected funny old
chairs and soft shades of blue cretonne found in the
remnant department, queer pottery, Indian blankets,
and a set of blue dishes which just naturally demanded
to be heaped with good things and eaten
before an open fire at Sunday-night supper.</p>
<p>The whole expense came within Mary&rsquo;s economical
pocketbook, yet it seemed to Steve to have the combined
richness of a Persian palace and the geniality
of a nursery on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>He deliberately invented an excuse to call, some
detail of work which, more easily than not, could
have waited until the next day. He was not only
using the detail of work as a means to visit Mary
but as an excuse to escape a parlour lecture on &ldquo;What
astral vibrations does your given name bring you?&rdquo;
by a pale-faced young woman. The pale-faced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
young woman boasted of an advanced soul and was
making a snug bank account from the rich set in
undertaking occult analyses of their names by which
to decide whether or not the accompanying astral
vibrations harmonized with their auras; and if they
did not&ndash;&ndash;and were therefore detrimental and hampering
to spiritual development and material progress&ndash;&ndash;she
would evolve occult names for them which
would be sort of spiritual bits of cheese in material
mousetraps baiting and capturing all the good things
of this world and the next.</p>
<p>Convinced that Beatrice was not the proper name
for her the Gorgeous Girl had ordered a chart of
cabalistic signs and mystical statements, the sum
total of which was that Radia was the name the astral
forces wished her to be called, and by using this
name she would develop into a wonderful medium.
She paid fifty dollars to discover that she ought to be
called Radia and that her aura was of smoky lavender,
denoting an advanced soul&ndash;&ndash;according to the
pale-faced young woman, who had tired of teaching
nonsensical flappers, had no chance to marry, and
had hit upon this as her means of painlessly extracting
a little <i>joie de vie</i>.</p>
<p>Declining to learn his astral name Steve left Gaylord
to mop up the astral vibrations. Beatrice did
not mind his absence though he neglected to say that
the work was to be done at Miss Faithful&rsquo;s apartment
and not at the office. Never having questioned
Steve in such details Beatrice merely murmured inwardly
that goat tending in one&rsquo;s past strangely
enough led to pigheadedness in later life. It was a
relief to have him away, for if drawn into an argument
he still thumped his fists. For everyday living
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Beatrice preferred her own pet robins and angel-ducks,
as she called the boys of the younger set, who
flocked to flirt with her because she was extremely
rich and pretty and they were in no danger of being
matrimonially entangled.</p>
<p>Of course Gaylord ate up this occult-name affair.
It was discovered that Gaylord&rsquo;s was a most hampering
name and had his parents only consulted the
stars and named him Scintar&ndash;&ndash;who knows to what
heights he might not have risen? Trudy&rsquo;s astral
title should have been Urcia, which she now adopted,
blushing deeply as she recalled the vulgar Babseley
and Bubseley of former days. But when Aunt
Belle was informed that Cinil was the cognomen
needed to make her discover an Indian-summer
millionaire waiting to bestow his heart upon her Mark
Constantine had packed his bags and departed unceremoniously
for Hot Springs.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mary did not know just how to treat
this imperious lonesome young man who came
boldly into her household without apology or warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how often I&rsquo;ve wanted to come
and see you,&rdquo; he said, unashamedly, delighted that
Luke was out of the way and he could play in his
fashion the same as Beatrice did in hers. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
business, really. I just wanted to talk to you. You
assume so much formality at the office that though
I admit it may be wise I miss the real you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you just trumped up an excuse&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Mary began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. The DeGraff muddle can wait. It&rsquo;s
nice to be able just to sprawl about&ndash;&ndash;sprawl in a
comfortable old chair. I like this little room. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
are being turned into an Italian villa, you know. I
don&rsquo;t quite see how I&rsquo;ll ever live up to it.&rdquo; As he
spoke he took out a plebeian tobacco pouch and a
nondescript pipe. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do! Only you ought not to be here at all&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;trying
to be severe, and failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you think only of yourself and of what
you wish,&rdquo; she surprised him by answering. &ldquo;Why
not think of the other chap occasionally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused in the lighting of his pipe. &ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;you
mean my coming here.&rdquo; He looked like an unjustly
punished child without redress. &ldquo;You mean to
consign me to the gloom of the grill room or one of
those slippery leather chairs in a far corner of the
club? Come, you can&rsquo;t say that. I won&rsquo;t listen
if you do. I just want to be friends with someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With unsuspected coquetry she suggested: &ldquo;Why
not your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not friends&ndash;&ndash;merely married.&rdquo; He lit
his pipe and flipped the match away. &ldquo;Cheap to
say, isn&rsquo;t it? Don&rsquo;t look at me like that; you make
me quite conscience-stricken. You seem to be aiming
at me as directly as a small boy aims his snowball.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do the slightest good to tell you what
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it would; someone must tell me. I&rsquo;ve never
been as lonesome in my life as now&ndash;&ndash;when I&rsquo;m a rich
man and the husband of a very lovely woman. It
sort of chills me to the marrow at first thought. I&rsquo;ve
been in a delirium, quite irresponsible. These last
few months I&rsquo;ve been coming down to earth. Only
instead of getting my feet planted firmly on the sod
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
I think I&rsquo;ve struck a quicksand bed. I say, lend
us a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t just know. I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever
be quite so sure of anything again. After all, a
person has just so much capacity for joy and sorrow,
and so much energy, and so much will power, allotted
at birth; and if he chooses to go burn it all up
in one fell swoop doing one thing&ndash;&ndash;he is at liberty to
do so; but he is not given any second helping. Isn&rsquo;t
that true? Quite a terrible thing to realize when you
know you used up your joy allotment in anticipation&ndash;&ndash;and
it has been so much keener and finer than any
of the realization. And all my energy went into
making money the easiest way I could; but it does
not pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary clasped her hands tightly in her lap; she
was afraid to let him see her joy at the long-awaited
confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you ask me, a reliable machine, to help you
in your perplexities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of you as a capable machine any
more. I used to, that is true enough. I didn&rsquo;t
know or care whether your hair was red or your eyes
green&ndash;&ndash;but I know now that you have gray eyes,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really want to know my opinions?&rdquo; she interrupted,
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as I used to seek out the stock reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;I think people who have planned as exactly
as you and Mr. Constantine have planned always
banish real principle at the start. After a time
you are punished by having an almost fungous
growth of sickly conscience&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t want to face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
the truth of things, yet isolated incidents, sentimental
memories, certain sights and definite statements
annoy, haunt, heartbreak you! Still, you have lost
your principle, the backbone of the soul, and the
fungus-like growth of conscience is such a clumsy
imitation&ndash;&ndash;like a paper rose stuck in the ground.
Mr. Constantine&rsquo;s type&ndash;&ndash;your type&ndash;&ndash;is flourishing
and multiplying among us, I fear, and such are the
wishbone, or sickly conscience, and not the backbone,
or sterling principle, of the nation. After all, fortunes
alone do not make real gentility&ndash;&ndash;thanks be!
But you know as well as I that all the&ndash;&ndash;the Gorgeous
Girls and their kind and you and I and the next chap
we meet belong to the great majority, and of that we
have every right to be proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, we ought to hold to our place in
the social scheme and be the backbone of the nation,
keep our principle and not be nagged eternally by a
sickly conscience after we have gone and sold our
birthrights. Gorgeous Girls and their sort have the
sole fortification of dollars, endless dollars, endless
price tags; their whims bring whole wings of foreign
castles floating across the ocean by the wholesale
to be reassembled somewhere in good old helpless
Illinois or New Jersey. And these people try to be
everything but good old American stock&ndash;&ndash;which is
quite wrong, for their example causes spendthrifts
and Bolsheviki to flourish without end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said, almost sulkily, as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched it for thirteen years from the various
angles of the working girl with an average amount of
brain and disposition. When all is said and done you
really have to work before you have earned the right
to pass judgment&ndash;&ndash;work&ndash;&ndash;not read or patronize or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
take someone else&rsquo;s statements as final. Do you
know how I used to identify the kinds of people that
rode in the street cars with me?... From
seven until eight there were the Frumps. The
majority boasted of white kid boots or someone&rsquo;s discarded
near-electric-seal jacket, plumes in their
hats, and an absence of warm woollens. And everyone
yawned, between patting thin cheeks with soiled
face chamois, &lsquo;What d&rsquo;ja do las&rsquo; night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From eight to nine came the Funnies; and the
majority had white kid boots and flimsy silk frocks
cut as low as our grandmothers&rsquo; party gowns, and
plumes in their hats and silver vanity cases. Their
main topics of conversation were: &lsquo;He said,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;She said,&rsquo; and &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m late. I&rsquo;m going
to quit anyway!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From nine until noon came the Frills&ndash;&ndash;the wives
of modest-salaried men who cannot motor, yet write
to out-of-town relatives that they do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every one of those Frumps, Funnies, and
Frills apes the Gorgeous-Girl kind&ndash;&ndash;white kids for
shopping, low-cut pumps in January, bizarre coat,
chiffon waist disclosing a thin little neck fairly panting
for protection, rouged cheeks, and a plume in her
hat&ndash;&ndash;and not a cent of savings in the bank!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s something wrong when we&rsquo;ve come
to this, and the wrong does not lie with these people
but with those they imitate&ndash;&ndash;Gorgeous Girls, new-rich
with sickly consciences and lack of principle and
common sense; and these Gorgeous Girls in turn take
their styles, slang phrases, and modes of recreation, as
well as theories of life from the boldest dancer, the
most sensational chorus girl&ndash;&ndash;and it&rsquo;s wrong and not
what America should be called upon to endure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
And it all reverts back in a sense to you busy, unprincipled,
yet conscience-stricken American business
men who write checks for these Gorgeous Girls&ndash;&ndash;and
the heathen in Africa&ndash;&ndash;and wonder why golf
doesn&rsquo;t bring your blood pressure down to normal&ndash;&ndash;when
your grandfather had such a wonderful constitution
at eighty-four! Don&rsquo;t you know that get-rich-quick
people always pay a usurer&rsquo;s interest on
the suddenly accumulated principle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on,&rdquo; he said in the same surly tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I go downtown and view the weary,
unwashed females and the overly ambitious painted
ones, people in impossible bargain shoes and summer
furs; fat men in plaid suits and Alpine hats; undernourished
children being dragged along by unthinking
adults; stray dogs wistfully sniffing at passers-by
in hopes of finding a permanent friend; tired, blind
work horses standing in the sun and resignedly being
overloaded for the day&rsquo;s haul; fire sales of fur coats;
candy sales of gooey hunks; a jewellery special of earrings
warranted to betray no tarnish until well after
Christmas; brokers&rsquo; ads and vaudeville billboards and
rows upon rows of awful, huddled-up, gardenless
homes with families lodged somewhere between the
first and twelfth stories&ndash;&ndash;the general chasing after
nothing, saving nothing and, saddest of all, the complacent
delusion that they have achieved something
well worth while&ndash;&ndash;it makes me willing to earn and
learn as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me in the quicksand. What can
we do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make that sort of American woman realize that
she is more needed in the home and can accomplish
more with that as her goal than in any other place in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
the world. You don&rsquo;t know all my dreams for the
American woman&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you think that this Gorgeous
Girl parasitical type is a result of the Victorian revolt?
Too late for themselves the Victorian matrons
said: &lsquo;Our daughters shall never slave as we have
done; they shall be ladies&ndash;&ndash;and have careers, too,
bless their hearts.&rsquo; The Victorian matrons were
emerging from the unfair conditions of ignorance
and drudgery and they could realize only one side
of the argument&ndash;&ndash;that all work and no play made
Jill quite a stupid girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must grasp the other side of the matter&ndash;&ndash;that
all play and no work make her simply impossible;
that culture and self-sufficiency can go hand in
hand. The American woman really is&ndash;&ndash;and must
continue to be&ndash;&ndash;the all-round, regular fellow of
the feminine world. Then she will not only teach
a great and needed truth to her backward European
sisters but she will produce a great future race.
American women have tried frivolity in nearly every
form and they have worked seriously likewise; they
have intruded into men&rsquo;s professions and careers
and in cases have beaten men at their own game.
They have successfully broken down the narrow prejudice
and limitations which the Victorian era tried
making immortal under the title of sentiment&ndash;&ndash;but
after they have had the reward of victory and the
knowledge of the game, why not be square, as they
really are, and do the part the Great Plan meant them
to do? Be women first&ndash;&ndash;let the career take the
woman if need be, but always thank the good Lord
if it needn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think you have been working for me,&rdquo;
Steve said, softly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that culture and enjoyment of life may
be yoked with so-called drudgery. I know, too, that
women are retiring not in defeat but with honour
and victory in its truest sense when they step out
of business life back to their homes. Nor are they
empty-handed like the Victorian matrons; but with
the energy of tried and true warriors, the ballot in
one hand, the child led by the other, they are in a
position to right old wrongs, for they have won new
rights. They will be able to put into practice in
their homes all they have gleaned from the sojourn
in the world; the ill-given service of unfitted menials
will disappear, as will waste and nerve-racking detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And love must be the leavener of it all&ndash;&ndash;with all
her progress and her ability, trained talents and
clever logic, the American woman must not and will
not renounce her romance&ndash;&ndash;for it is part of God&rsquo;s
very promise of immortality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often may I come here?&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>Mary shook her head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me started,
as Luke says, and I&rsquo;m hard to check. But have you
never thought that out of all the world the American
woman is the only woman who cooks and serves her
dinner if it is necessary, adjourns to her parlour afterward
and discusses poetry and politics and the latest
style hat with her guests? For she has learned how
to possess true democracy, not rebellion, courage
and not hysterical threats to play the rebel, the
slacker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll make you a cup of coffee. And
never let me catch you here again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Luke arrived home he found Steve O&rsquo;Valley
basking in the big chair he was wont to occupy,
though it was past ten o&rsquo;clock and he had anticipated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
questions from Mary as to his tardiness. Instead
he found a very rosy-cheeked, almost sunrise-eyed
sister who stammered her greeting as the flustered
Mr. O&rsquo;Valley found his hat and the neglected business
portfolio and took his leave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>To keep down the rising tide of overweight
Beatrice abandoned the occult method of
having a good time and turned her interest
to new creeds containing continual bogus joy and a
denial of the vicarious theory of life. But when she
discovered that optimism was no deterrent to the
oncoming tide of flesh she began a vigorous course
in face bleaching, reducing, massage, and electrical
treatments, with Trudy playing attentive friend and
confidante and secretly chuckling over the Gorgeous
Girl&rsquo;s fast-appearing double chin and her disappearing
waistline.</p>
<p>The extensive work of making the house into an
Italian villa kept Beatrice from brooding too much
over her <i>embonpoint</i>. She enjoyed the endless conferences
with the decorators, drapers, artists, and
who-nots, with Gay&rsquo;s suave, flattering little self
always at her elbow, his tactful remarks about So-and-so
being altogether too thin, and the wonderful
nutritive value of chocolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bea will look like a fishwife when she is forty,&rdquo;
he told Trudy soon after the villa was under way and
the first anniversary drew near. &ldquo;She eats as much
candy in a week as an orphan asylum on Christmas
Day. Why doesn&rsquo;t someone tell her to stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay felt rather kindly toward Beatrice, for his commissions
from the villa transformation made him
secure for some time to come; Alice Twill&rsquo;s idea of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
French ch&acirc;teau, however, had blown up unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t people tell you that you look an
utter fool with that extra-intelligent edition of tortoise-shell
glasses that you wear?&rdquo; Trudy retorted.
Gay was her husband and her property as long as
she saw fit to stay his wife, and she did not approve
of his constant attendance on the Gorgeous Girl.
Even her deliberate retaliation by flirting with the
gouty-toe brigade did not make amends. She had
moments of depression similar to the time she had
learned Mary&rsquo;s secret. But she did not go back to
Mary in the same abandoned spirit. It would never
do. If she were not careful she would begin to think
for herself and want to take to sensible shoes and a
real job, hating herself so utterly that she could never
have any more good times. So she saw Mary only
at intervals and tried to do nice trifles for her. Trudy
was thinner than ever and she had an annoying
cough. She still used a can opener as an aide-de-camp
in housekeeping and laughed at snow flurries
in her low shoes and gauze-like draperies.</p>
<p>It delighted her to have Beatrice become heavy
of figure&ndash;&ndash;it almost gave her a hold on her, she
fancied&ndash;&ndash;for Beatrice sighed with envy at Trudy&rsquo;s
one hundred and ten pounds and used Trudy as an
argument for eating candy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trudy eats candy, lots of it, and she stays thin,&rdquo;
she told Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but she works and you don&rsquo;t. You don&rsquo;t
even pay a gymnasium instructor for daily perseverance,
for you could do exercises yourself if you
wanted. You sleep late and keep the house like the
equator,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Beatrice looked at him in scorn. &ldquo;Do I ever
please you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You married me,&rdquo; he said, gallantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I did that I was thinking about pleasing
only you, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; was his reward. &ldquo;I wish you
would study French&ndash;&ndash;you have such a queer education
you can&rsquo;t help having queer ideas. And you
can&rsquo;t always go along with such funny views and be
like papa. There isn&rsquo;t room for two in the same
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the Bible?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Beatrice giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are! You think I haven&rsquo;t studied
in my own fashion. Well, if you did know the Bible
intellectually, and Milton&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a correspondence-school course.
Don&rsquo;t, Stevuns! Do you know the latest dance from
Spain&ndash;&ndash;the <i>paso-doble</i>? Of course you don&rsquo;t. You
don&rsquo;t know any of the romance of the Ming Dynasty
or how to tell a Tanagra figurine from a plaster-of-paris
shepherdess. You haven&rsquo;t read a single Russian
novel; you just glare and stare when they&rsquo;re mentioned.
You won&rsquo;t play bridge, you can&rsquo;t sing or
make shadow pictures or imitate any one. Good
gracious, now that you&rsquo;ve made a fortune&ndash;&ndash;enjoy
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was silent. It was not only futile to argue&ndash;&ndash;it
was nerve-racking. Besides, he had found someone
else with whom argument was a rare joy and a
personal gain&ndash;&ndash;Mary Faithful. At frequent intervals
he had won a welcome at the doorway of the
little apartment. He almost wished that Beatrice
would find it out and row about it, leaving him in
peace. He had not yet assumed unselfish views as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
to the matter. He was no longer in love with his
wife but he was not yet in love with Mary. Instead
he was passing through that interlude, whose brevity
has made the world doubt its existence, known as
platonic friendship. Platonic friendship does exist
but it is like tropical twilight&ndash;&ndash;the one whirlwind second
in which brilliant sunshine and blue skies dip
down and the stars and the moon dash up&ndash;&ndash;and then
the trick is done!</p>
<p>But like the thief who audaciously walks by the
house of his victim, Steve was never accused of anything
worse than using his leisure time to frequent
those low restaurants where they serve everything
on a two-inch-thick platter. Which, he had retorted,
was a relief from eating turtle steak off green-glass
dinner plates.</p>
<p>The first wedding anniversary was a rather disappointing
affair since Beatrice had to remodel her
wedding gown in order to wear it. That fact alone
was distressing. And at the eleventh hour Steve was
called out of town, which left Beatrice in the hands
of her angel-duck brigade, who all felt it their duty
to paint Steve in terms of reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Steve felt just as badly about going as you
do to have him away,&rdquo; her father said by way of
clumsy consolation. &ldquo;And he bought you a mighty
handsome gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have one quite as lovely,&rdquo; Beatrice objected.
&ldquo;It was unpardonable of him to go, even
if there was a strike and a fire. Let the police arrest
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid aside the gift, a glittering head-dress in
the form of platinum Mercury wings set with diamonds,
fitting close to the head and giving a decided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Brunnhilde effect. &ldquo;I hate duplicates; I always want
something different and novel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I gave you a check,&rdquo; said her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, because Gay can always find me something&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;brightening.
&ldquo;And tell me, how is the salon fresco
coming on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father held up his hands in protest. &ldquo;Ask
something easy. A mob of workmen and sleek
gentlemen that tiptoe about like undertakers&rsquo; assistants&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
all I know. But not one of them
touches my room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, papa.&rdquo; She kissed him prettily. &ldquo;And
as I&rsquo;m dead for sleep and aunty is snoring in her chair,
suppose you wake her up and run along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Summoning Aunt Belle, who was approaching the
Mrs. Skewton stage of wanting a continuous rose-curtain
effect, Beatrice stood at the window with
unusual affection to wave the last of her guests a
good-bye.</p>
<p>She sat up until daylight, to her maid&rsquo;s dismay, still
in her remodelled wedding gown. She was thinking
chaotic, rebellious, ridiculous nothings, punctuated
with uneven ragged thoughts about matching gloves
to gowns or getting potted goose livers at the East-Side
store Trudy had just recommended. The general
trend of her reverie was the dissatisfaction not over
this first year of married life but at the twenty-seven
years as a Gorgeous Girl, the disappointment at not
having some vital impelling thing to do, which should
of course supply a good time as well as a desirable
achievement. The inherited energy was demanding
an outlet. She recalled the evening&rsquo;s entertainment&ndash;&ndash;a
paper chase with every room left littered and disordered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
her lace flounce badly torn, her head thumping
with pain, the latest dances, the inane music, the
scandal whispered between numbers, the elaborate
supper and favours, the elaborate farewells&ndash;&ndash;and
the elaborate lies about the charm of the hostess and
the good time.</p>
<p>She began to envy Steve as well as Trudy, Steve
in his hotel busy with Labour delegates, wrangling,
demanding, threatening, winning or losing as the
case might be. She, too, must do something. She
had finished with another series of adventures&ndash;&ndash;that
of being a mad butterfly. It was shelved with the
months of a romantic, parasitical existence misnaming
jealous monopoly as love, an existence which
all at once seemed as long ago as another lifetime.</p>
<p>She would now be an advanced woman, intellectual,
daring; she would allow her stunted abilities to have
definite expression. Either she would find a new
circle of friends or else swerve the course of the present
circle into an atmosphere of Ibsen, Pater, advanced
feminine thought, and so on&ndash;&ndash;with Egyptology
as a special side line. She would even become
an advocate of parlour socialism, perhaps. She
would encourage languid poets and sarcastic sex
novelists with matted hair and puff satin ties. She
would seek out short-haired mannish women with
theories and oodles of unpublished short stories,
and feed them well, opening her house for their
drawing-room talks. She would be a lion tamer!
She was done with sighing and tears, belonging to
the first stage of Glorious Girlism; and with pouting
and flirting, which belonged to the second&ndash;&ndash;she would
now make them roar, herself included!</p>
<p>At noon the next day she sought Mary Faithful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
in her office, to everyone&rsquo;s surprise. To her own
astonishment she discovered her husband busily
engaged in conversation with some members of the
Board of Trade, his travelling bag on a side table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bother to telephone you or wire&ndash;&ndash;I got
in at eight this morning and came right up here. I
knew you&rsquo;d not be up,&rdquo; he added, curtly. &ldquo;Would
you mind waiting in Miss Faithful&rsquo;s office until I&rsquo;m
at liberty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice was forced to consent graciously and pass
into the other room, where Mary was giving dictation.</p>
<p>When Mary finished she offered Beatrice a magazine
but the Gorgeous Girl declined it and began in
petulant fashion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about you, Miss Faithful, and
I do envy you. Do you know why? You have
more of my husband than I have; that was what I
came to tell you. For business is his very life and
you are his business partner. I only have the tired
remnant that occasionally wanders homeward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary wondered what Beatrice would say if she
knew of the supper talks she had had with the tired
remnant, who flung discretion to the winds and
clamoured for invitations as keenly as he had once
begged for the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, that&rsquo;s not true. You see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began,
but she simply could not finish the lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided that if business is more important to
my husband than his wedding anniversary I shall be
of importance to him in his business,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;Be careful&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve a rival looming ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve opened the door and nodded for his wife to
come in. Mary was left with rather unsteady nerves
and a pessimistic attitude to round out her day. Beatrice&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
hint had had an unpleasant petty sound that
she did not quite understand. She wished she had
never allowed Steve to draw her out of her businesslike
attitude. However, when she learned that he
had very unexpectedly called off work for the rest of
the day to do his wife&rsquo;s bidding she told herself she
was needlessly alarmed, though it was always a rash
thing to try exchanging her heartache for a temporary
joyful mirage!</p>
<p>The next evening, when Mary was in the throes of
explaining this thing in guarded fashion to Steve and
Steve was arguing angrily and begging for his welcome,
Trudy Vondeplosshe happened in unexpectedly
and very much rejoiced inwardly at finding this
delightful little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in full progress.</p>
<p>Of course the couple gave business and the recent
strike as an alarming necessity for a private conference,
and then Steve scuttled away, leaving Mary
to try to look unconscious and change the subject to
Trudy&rsquo;s new hat. But ever mindful of Mary&rsquo;s
confession Trudy was not to be swerved from the
topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Beatrice was not with me,&rdquo; she said,
sweetly, &ldquo;for like all heartless flirts she is jealous&ndash;&ndash;ashamed
of Steve half of the time and mad about him
the other half. I&rsquo;d try to have the business all
transacted at the office. You used to. And Beatrice
says business isn&rsquo;t half as brisk as it was then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upshot of the matter resulted in Mary&rsquo;s applying
for a two-months&rsquo; leave of absence. Spent in
the Far North woods with Luke it would make common
sense win over starved dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve earned it,&rdquo; was all she said to Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year ago I went away and you stayed. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
course you have earned it. But I am going to miss
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day before she left&ndash;&ndash;it was well into July before
she could conscientiously see her way clear to go&ndash;&ndash;she
received a plaid steamer rug. There was no
card attached to the gift, and when she was summoned
to Steve&rsquo;s apartment to inform him about
some matters, Steve having a slight attack of grippe,
she was so formal to both Steve and Beatrice, who
stayed in the room, making them very conscious of
her apricot satin and cream-lace presence, that Beatrice
remarked later:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fortunate thing that she isn&rsquo;t going to visit
the North Pole; she&rsquo;d be so chilly when she returned
you&rsquo;d have to wrap the entire office in a warming pad.
I was thinking this morning that with the way she
lives and manages she must have saved some money.
Do you know if she has&ndash;&ndash;and how much? I hope
you won&rsquo;t pay her her salary while she is gone. It&rsquo;s
no wonder she can afford nervous prostration if
you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know she had it,&rdquo; Steve said, dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, then, that makes her take all this
time. The way employees act, walking roughshod
in their rights! And now, deary, hurry and get well,
for I&rsquo;ve a wonderful surprise for you.&rdquo; She knelt
beside the couch and patted his cheek. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to be your private secretary during her absence&ndash;&ndash;yes,
I am. As soon as I finish making the mannikins for
the knitting bags at the kermis. Then I&rsquo;m going to
try to take her place&ndash;&ndash;well, a tiny part of her place to
start with, and work into the position gradually.
Yes, I am. I&rsquo;m determined to try it. I&rsquo;ve worried
and worried to decide what to do with myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>Worry was Beatrice&rsquo;s sole form of prayer. Steve
wondered if what Mary had recently said to him
could be true, at least in his own case. She had said
that defeat at thirty should be an incentive&ndash;&ndash;only
after fifty could it be counted a definite disaster.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
<a name='CHAPTER_XIII' id='CHAPTER_XIII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve missed you,&rdquo; Steve
told Mary upon her return. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I look
it?&rdquo; he added, wistfully.</p>
<p>Mary had appeared at the office late one September
afternoon rather than appear the following
morning as a model of exact punctuality. She had
had to force herself to remain away until her leave of
absence expired. It was Luke who rejoiced in the
freedom of the woods and the green growing things in
which his sister had tried to take consolation, telling
herself they would revive her common sense and banish
absurd notions concerning Steve O&rsquo;Valley. It was
Luke who rejoiced at catching the largest trout of the
season, who never wearied of hayrack rides and corn
roasts and bonfires with circles of ghostlike figures
enduring the smoke and the damp and the rapid-fire
gossiping and giggling. Luke had returned with a
healthy coat of tan and a large correspondence list,
pledging himself to revisit the spot every season.</p>
<p>But Mary felt defeated in the very purpose of her
holiday. The atmosphere of weary school-teachers
trying to appear as golden-haired flappers foot-loose
for a romance; the white shoes always drying outside
tents or along window sills; the college professors
eternally talking about their one three-months&rsquo;
tour of Europe; the mosquitoes; the professional
invalid, the inevitable divorcee; the woman with
literary ambitions and a typewriter set in action on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
the greenest, most secluded spot for miles about; the
constant snapshotting of everything from an angleworm
to a group of arm-entwined bathers about to
play splash-me; the cheap talk and aping of such
Gorgeous Girls as Beatrice Constantine&ndash;&ndash;all this on
one side, and a great and eternal loneliness for Steve
on the other.</p>
<p>It was small wonder that defeat was the result.
And yet in her heart of hearts Mary was glad that it
was so. There is something splendid and breathless
in trying to shut away a forbidden rapture, and being
unable to do so; in telling oneself one will never try
repression again but will shamelessly acknowledge
the forbidden rapture and register a desire to thrill
to it whenever possible.</p>
<p>Besides the irritations of the summer camp Mary
had been forced to leave Hanover remembering
Steve as ill, worried over business; of Beatrice&rsquo;s
hinting that she would usurp her place. There had
been so many womanly trifles she would have done
for Steve had she been in Beatrice&rsquo;s position&ndash;&ndash;a
linen cover for the water glass; a soft shade on the
window instead of the glaring white-and-gold-striped
affair; exile for that ubiquitous spaniel; home
cooking, with old-fashioned milk toast and real
coffee of a forefather&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Strange how such homey trifles persist in the mind
of a commercial nun through two months of supposed
enjoyment and liberty. In the same way
incongruous associations of ideas spring into the
brain with no apparent reason at all causing fossilized
professors to write essays-under-glass that elucidate
matters not in the slightest.</p>
<p>So Mary returned to the office two days ahead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
time, her heart thumping so loudly that she thought
Miss Lunk would surely detect the sound. She
deliberately dressed herself in a demure new suit and
a becoming black-winged hat which made her seem
as if delightfully arrayed for afternoon tea. And it
was with a charming timidity that she tiptoed into
the office.</p>
<p>Before Steve had asked her opinion she had given
one swift look about the two offices, and she was glad
that they looked as they did. It would have been
disappointing to have found them spick and span
and quite self-sufficient, without a hint that Mary
Faithful was missed or irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Evidences of Beatrice&rsquo;s brief sojourn in the business
world still remained&ndash;&ndash;an elaborate easy-chair
with rose pillows, a thermos bottle and cut-glass
tumbler, a curlicue French mirror slightly awry and,
on her desk, a gay-bordered silk handkerchief, a
silver-mesh bag, and a great amount of cluttered
notations; all of which proved that the understudy
secretary had not yet mastered the law of efficiency.</p>
<p>It seemed amusing to Mary. She thought: &ldquo;How
stupid! How can she&ndash;&ndash;when the wicker basket is
the one logical place for&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she spied Steve&rsquo;s desk, bearing a suggestion of
the same disorder about it. When she spoke his name
and he started up, holding out both hands, she saw a
queer, bright look in his eyes, as if he, too, were trying
to convince himself that everything was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you really missed me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed you! Heaven alone can record the
unselfish struggle I endured to let you play. I give
you my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wheeled up a chair for her, just as he used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
wheel up a chair for Beatrice, and sitting opposite
him Mary heard an almost womanish enumeration
of petty troubles and disturbances, a pathetic threat
as to the avalanche of work which would await her in
the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I will be polite enough to ask if you had
a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very! And Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so horrid to have to pretend when each
knew the other was pretending; and as they pretended
to the world in general, what a relief and
blessed lightening of tension it would have been to
have said merely an honest: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care about
Mrs. Gorgeous Girl or any one else. We are quite
content with each other. True, this is still platonic
friendship&ndash;&ndash;with one of us&ndash;&ndash;but all tropical twilight
is of short duration. It won&rsquo;t be platonic much
longer. So let&rsquo;s talk about ourselves all we like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But being thoroughbred young persons they felt it
was not the thing even to think frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is well,&rdquo; Steve said, briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came down here, she wrote me, when she
wanted to find out about something or other. I&rsquo;ve
forgotten just what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve smiled. &ldquo;Yes, for nearly a week Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley
managed to create a furore among her own set.
Before she came here she ordered an entire new
outfit of clothes&ndash;&ndash;business togs. There were queer
hats and shirt waists and things.&rdquo; He laughed at
the remembrance. &ldquo;Then she had to practise
getting up early; that took a lot of time. Meanwhile,
Miss Sartwell did your work just as we planned.
It was found necessary to postpone her business
career still further because of an out-of-door pageant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
that required her services as a nymph. She caught
cold at rehearsal and enjoyed a week of indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Gay turned up with a whole flock of new
decorators for the d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;for the villa thing, and I was
left without aid from the <i>ennuied</i> for another ten
days. Jill Briggs had a wedding anniversary and
relied on Beatrice&rsquo;s aid. Of course she could not refuse,
and Trudy, who, by the way, has come on very
rapidly, persuaded Beatrice to take a booth at a
charity kettledrum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So after several weeks my wife appeared on my
business horizon and hung that mirror up and had
those other things moved in and then she discovered
that the impudent girls were all copying her coats
and hats and stuff and even used her sort of perfume,
and she decided that her duty lay not in making me a
competent secretary but in reforming these extravagant
young persons so that she could wear a model
gown in comfort and not see it copied within a month.
It was quite an experience for her; she was here about
five days. Miss Sartwell just moved her desk out
there and we managed nicely. Beatrice also had a
private teacher for typewriting and so on, but she
gave it all up because she felt the confinement and
long hours made her head ache and she gained
weight. She fled in haste. Sorry she had to do so,
but under the circumstances it was better to jeopardize
my business career than her own figure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a little unfair?&rdquo; Mary said, seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? I never thought so. Wait&ndash;&ndash;I must
finish the tale. For a whole week after being my
business partner she tried what she called holiness as
a cosmetic, and became high-church and quite trying.
At the end of that time she felt a veritable dynamo of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
nerves and scandal and proceeded to become a
liberated and advanced woman. You&rsquo;ll soon enough
see what I mean. She doesn&rsquo;t run to short-haired
ladies with theories so much as to hollow-eyed gentlemen
embroidering cantos in the drawing room and
trying to make the world safe for poetry. De-luxe
adventuresses strike her as harmonious just now.
You&rsquo;ll hear about one Sezanne del Monte who is
staying in town and living off of Bea and her set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman who is divorced every season&ndash;&ndash;and
stars in musical comedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. Sezanne is now writing the intimate
story of her life; sort of heart throbs instead of
punctuation marks&ndash;&ndash;lots of asterisks, you know,
separating the paragraphs. Beatrice is going to
finance the publication of it and Gay is going to be
the sales manager. Yes, it&rsquo;s funny, but a blamed
nuisance when you come home and you find yourself
wandering through a crowd of Sezanne del Montes
and Gays and Trudys, all bent on playing parlour
steeplechase, and you can&rsquo;t find a plain chair to sit
down or eat a plain meal or read a newspaper. It&rsquo;s
more than a blamed nuisance&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s cause for a trial
by jury,&rdquo; he added, whimsically. &ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s
wrong?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;watching Mary&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t cricket to tell all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the old struggle began with renewed
energy in Mary&rsquo;s heart, the puritanical part saying:
&ldquo;Forget you ever thought twice of this man&rdquo;; and
the dreamer part urging: &ldquo;You have earned the right
to love him. She has not. Just be fair&ndash;&ndash;merely
fair. You have the right; don&rsquo;t let your opportunity
slip by.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;<i>It was with a charming timidity that she tip-toed into the office</i>&rdquo;<br />

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I tell you? I have no one else to
whom I can tell things&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m so everlastingly
tired. Goat tending and living off dried buffalo
meat never fagged me like trying to dance with
Trudy and living on truffles and champagne. First
you are mentally bewildered and physically fagged,
then you become defiant; then you realize that that
is no use, you&rsquo;ve brought this on your own self&ndash;&ndash;it is
quite the common fate of men like myself&ndash;&ndash;and so you
keep on with the steady grind; and by and by you
find yourself longing to play in your own way with
your own sort. The other sort have no use for you
so long as you pay their bills; you are hardly missed,
if the truth were told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must keep on with the grind. And
you want your sort of playmates and fun, and
it&rsquo;s such decent, upright fun in comparison&ndash;&ndash;oh,
pshaw!&rdquo; He stood up, kicking the edge of the rug
with his foot in almost boyish, shamed fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business isn&rsquo;t quite so good,&rdquo; he began anew in
an impersonal, even voice. &ldquo;Mr. Constantine thinks
that the abnormal prosperity is on the wane for
keeps&ndash;&ndash;we must prepare for it&ndash;&ndash;but Mr. Constantine
has practically retired since you have been away.
He&rsquo;s not well. To-morrow morning, if you don&rsquo;t
mind, I&rsquo;ll take you over there and we can straighten
out some things for him. He is selling the greater
share of stock to men from the West. And he&rsquo;s saved
out some pretty nice sugar plums to hand over to me.
I haven&rsquo;t been asked whether or not I want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would be, Miss Iconoclast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you accept them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By saying you are not prepared to be a mental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
wreck at forty&ndash;&ndash;which you will be if you try such a
gigantic scheme with so little preparation. I&rsquo;ve an
idea that when Mr. Constantine is known to have
withdrawn from the business world there will be a
change in many things. And when you are known
to be alone in the fort&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he demanded, irritably. &ldquo;Can I never
make you understand how much I want your advice,
your opinions, your scoldings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will have new enemies with whom to
deal&ndash;&ndash;enemies you never thought existed. I don&rsquo;t
believe you can deal with them because you have
always been so cotton-woolled, so to speak, by being
Constantine&rsquo;s special project&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done what I&rsquo;ve done myself,&rdquo; he interrupted,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m afraid of no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think you have,&rdquo; she corrected. &ldquo;You have
done what you have because Constantine was back of
you&ndash;&ndash;and now he is an old, tired man, and very soon
he will think more of his days with Hannah than
of the present. Which is perfectly safe for him to do.
Because Mr. Constantine reckoned on his enemies he
knew to a man who hated him and who was afraid of
him, who admired him and who would be indifferent;
and that is just as essential to success as to reckon on
your friends. You never did that&ndash;&ndash;you hadn&rsquo;t the
time&ndash;&ndash;it was all so dazzling and sudden with the war
helping things along at breakneck speed. You will
find that if you have an Achilles&rsquo; heel it will be
because you did not reckon on your enemies and are
somewhat like a blindfolded man with money in your
purse set down in a strange locality.... There.
How does that sound for a welcome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was pacing up and down the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
enemies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see them try jumping
at my throat. I&rsquo;d make them cry quits. You don&rsquo;t
frighten me; you stimulate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my intention&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;picking up her purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go&ndash;&ndash;or let me come to supper,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>She shook her head. Someone came in just then
to whom she spoke of the pleasure it was to be back
at the office; the word spread that Miss Faithful was
back and girls came in groups to smile and say some
pretty thing, and the men nodded with a pleased
expression. Watching the procedure Steve realized
that Mary was as dominant a personality in his
office as he was himself, and instead of feeling a vague
disapproval of the fact he was genuinely elated that
it was so.</p>
<p>After the last of the visitors had gone and the clock
pointed to five he said: &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m going to be
dragged some place this evening, so I wouldn&rsquo;t have
much time&ndash;&ndash;but may I come to supper? I&rsquo;m going
out of town next week. There, isn&rsquo;t that a good
reason to come to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the world knew this&ndash;&ndash;our little business
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never did. You flattered it, and were
delighted when the world patted you on the head and
said, &lsquo;Nice Stevens, come in and bring your bags of
gold&ndash;&ndash;the living&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you starting in to tell me that people would
misunderstand my motives? Sezanne del Monte
has chapters along those lines. And Beatrice has
quite a fad of slumming and taking a notebook along
to write down new slang phrases or oaths or bits of
heart-broken philosophy spilled in a drunken moment....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
I&rsquo;ve grown careless to everything
presumably orderly and conventional. I&rsquo;m ready
to walk the plank for my indifference if need be&ndash;&ndash;but
I do want to come home with you for supper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary did not answer for a moment. Then she
said, in a quick breathless tone, as if she did not want
to hear her own words: &ldquo;I wonder if it would do any
good to try explaining&ndash;&ndash;really explaining and not
fibbing or pretending&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has always done me good when you have explained&ndash;&ndash;and
I can&rsquo;t imagine you telling cheap untruths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will try it.&rdquo; The gray eyes grew stormy.
&ldquo;For if we are to continue as employer and secretary&ndash;&ndash;and
you must have such a person and I must
earn my living&ndash;&ndash;it would be much easier if you really
understood and it was all settled. You&rsquo;ve talked
about early hardships, misunderstood childhood,
goat tending, and what not; and the world gives you
credit for your achievements. Then surely you
must understand the woman&rsquo;s end of the game&ndash;&ndash;the
American woman&rsquo;s part in business, for it&rsquo;s not easy
to be errand girl or to fill endless underpaid clerical
positions. It&rsquo;s not easy to pile out every morning at
such and such an hour and stand at a desk and work
as if you had neither heart nor eye for the other things
in life until gradually the woman part of yourself is
changed and it is often too late to enjoy anything
but desk drudgery&ndash;&ndash;and a bonus!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the man in the business game forgoes nothing;
he has the world&rsquo;s applause if he succeeds and
the kisses of the woman he loves for his recreation,
and all is complete and as it should be. But we
commercial women of to-day do a man&rsquo;s work and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
earn a man&rsquo;s wage. We do stay starved women,
even if that fact doesn&rsquo;t appear on the surface. We
cannot have the things of romance as well as our
livelihood. And by the very nature of the average
business woman&rsquo;s life she is often in love with someone
in her office&ndash;&ndash;from propinquity if for no other
reason. She must. Don&rsquo;t you see? They&rsquo;re practically
the only men she really comes to know or
who come to know her, and she just can&rsquo;t stab her
heart into sudden death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she wears her prettiest frock for this man&ndash;&ndash;a
wooden-faced bookkeeper perhaps; or a preoccupied
president&ndash;&ndash;and she dreams of him and is
jealous of him and very likely gossips about him.
And the years pass and she stays just as shut away
and misunderstood and starved. And sometimes a
woman, originally the most honest in the world,
under these circumstances will deliberately steal
another woman&rsquo;s husband if she has the chance.
Yes, she will&ndash;&ndash;she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Mary?&rdquo; He was almost
unconscious of using the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am no different from the others. I came
here with the same starved heart and woman&rsquo;s hopes,
and I put into your career the devotion and service
and very prayers that I should have put into a home
and a family&ndash;&ndash;your joys were my joys, your problems
mine. It has not been my clever brain that has
made me worth so much to you. That is what the
superficial public says, but I know better. It&rsquo;s been
the love&ndash;&ndash;yes, the love for you that has made me indispensable!
The unreturned and unsuspected and
I presume wicked love I felt for you. And now I&rsquo;ve
told you&ndash;&ndash;broken precedent and told the truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
And as you don&rsquo;t love me you&rsquo;ll feel very uncomfortable
with me about. And you won&rsquo;t want to play
off pal; you&rsquo;ll fight shy of me except for everyday
work. So it has been the only square thing to do&ndash;&ndash;humiliate
myself into telling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you, I always have, and I always will&ndash;&ndash;but
I&rsquo;m no home-wrecking, emotional being and I expect
that you will resume our old relationships and I shall
go on serving you and knowing my recompense will
be a handsome farewell gift and a pension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the business woman&rsquo;s life isn&rsquo;t all beer and
skittles. We&rsquo;re expected to lie about our hearts,
yet be as reliable as an adding machine about our
columns of figures; to be shut away from the social
world, thrown with men more hours a day than their
wives see them and yet remain immovable, aloof,
disinterested! Just good fellows, you know. Isn&rsquo;t
it hideous to think I&rsquo;ve really told the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this identical moment their platonic friendship,
alias tropical twilight, ended, and Mary&rsquo;s evening
star of romance rose to stay. But such being the
case Steve was the last person in the world to try to
convince her that it was so.</p>
<p>All he said was: &ldquo;I never appreciated you before.
Please don&rsquo;t feel that telling me this will make any
difference save that I&rsquo;ll stay aloof&ndash;&ndash;as you suggest.
I can forget it, somewhat, if that will make you feel
any better about it. It is all quite true and equally
hopeless&ndash;&ndash;true things usually are&ndash;&ndash;and if you like
I&rsquo;ll send you home in the car, because you must be a
trifle tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she remembered answering as she
told Steve&rsquo;s chauffeur where to drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as tired as before we went away,&rdquo; Luke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
complained that same night when Mary sat at her
desk adding up expenses and making out checks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. This shade makes everyone look
ghastly,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get a hump on and make my pile,&rdquo;
he consoled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my sister being all tired
out before she&rsquo;s too old to have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good time?&rdquo; Mary repeated. &ldquo;Are you inoculated,
too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with a good time? I guess Steve
O&rsquo;Valley plays all he likes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I guess he does,&rdquo; Mary forced herself
to answer.</p>
<p>When Steve returned home that evening he found
one of those impromptu dinner parties on hand instead
of a formal engagement. They had become
quite the fad in Bea&rsquo;s set. The idea was this&ndash;&ndash;young
matrons convened in the afternoon at one of
their homes for cocktails and confidences; very likely
Sezanne del Monte would drop in to read her last
chapter or Gay Vondeplosshe would arrive brandishing
his cane and telling everyone how beautiful the
Italian villa was to be; and by and by they would
gather round the piano to sing the latest songs; then
when the clock struck six there would be a wild
flutter and a suggestion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s phone cook to bring over our dinner. Then
our husbands can come along or not just as they
like. We&rsquo;ll have a parlour picnic; and no one will
bother about being dressed. And we&rsquo;ll go to the
nickel dance hall later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was followed by a procession of cooks arriving
in state in various motor cars and carrying covered
trays and vacuum bottles and departing in high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
spirits at the early close of their day&rsquo;s work. Then
the procession of subdued husbands would follow,
and conglomerate menus would be spread on a
series of tea tables throughout the rooms, with
Sezanne smoking her small amber-stemmed pipe and
describing her sojourn in a Turkish harem while Gay
picked minor chords on his ukulele. After a later
diversion of nickel dance halls and slumming the
young matrons would say good-bye, preparing to sleep
until noon, quite convinced that any one would have
called it a day.</p>
<p>Such a party greeted Steve, with Gay showing
plans for Beatrice&rsquo;s secret room with a sliding panel&ndash;&ndash;clever
idea, splendid when they would be playing
hide and seek&ndash;&ndash;and the cooks en route with the kettles
and bottles of wine and the husbands meekly
arriving in sulky silence.</p>
<p>A little before two in the morning Steve escorted
Aunt Belle back to the Constantine house.</p>
<p>Beatrice had started to go to bed, but thinking of
something she wished to ask Steve she stationed
herself in his room, some candy near at hand and
Sezanne&rsquo;s manuscript as solace until he should arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to ask you if Mary Faithful has returned,&rdquo;
she said, throwing down the manuscript
as he came in. &ldquo;Heavens, don&rsquo;t look like a thundercloud!
You used to complain about getting into
evening dress for dinner; and now when they are as
informal as a church supper you row even more.
How was papa? Did you go in to see him? Does
the house look terrible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t see your father at two in the
morning; he was asleep. Your aunt fell into a bucket
of plaster.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Plaster! Why did the men leave it where she
could fall into it? Did it hurt her dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, just her bones.&rdquo; Steve laughed in spite of
himself. &ldquo;The dress hadn&rsquo;t started to begin where
the bones hit the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice giggled. &ldquo;Aunt Belle will try to look
like a Kate Greenaway creation. And isn&rsquo;t Jill
stout? I&rsquo;d eat stones before I&rsquo;d get like her. Well,
what about the Faithful woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why such a title? It was always Mary Faithful,
and even Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;but ever since I worked with you
this summer I&rsquo;ve realized what an easy time she has.
She isn&rsquo;t burdened with friends and social duties.
It&rsquo;s all so clearcut and straight-ahead sailing for her.
I suppose she laughs at her day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can go to the Berkshires. Sezanne
knows an artist and some people from Chicago who
are ripping company and they are going to visit her
cousin at Great Barrington and we are all invited
there&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once and for all,&rdquo; Steve said, shortly, to his own
surprise, &ldquo;I am not in on this! Just count yourself
a fair young widow for the time being. I cannot
run my business, help close up your father&rsquo;s affairs,
be a social puppet, and go chasing off with bob-haired
freaks to the Berkshires, and expect to survive.
I&rsquo;m going to work and keep on the job&ndash;&ndash;it will be
bad enough when I have to live in an Italian villa.
Who knows what new tortures that will bring? But
for a few months I am certain of my whereabouts, so
plan on going alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t come with me! Oh, Steve, sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
I can just see the whole mistake&ndash;&ndash;you should
never have made a fortune. Rather you should have
been a nice foreman with a meek little wife in four-dollar
hats and a large portion of offspring. You
should have lived in a model bungalow with even a
broom closet in the kitchen and leaded windows at
one side. You would have been a socialist and headed
labour-union picnics. But as my husband and my
father&rsquo;s assistant and all that&ndash;&ndash;you are as impossible
as that Faithful woman would be if she tried to be
a lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Steve hesitated. But the average
day does not include losing ten thousand on the stock
exchange from sheer folly, finding out that your blood
pressure is too high, that your faithful secretary
loves you and is truer blue than ever, and discovering
at the same moment that you love her yet may not
tell her so. Nor is a day so hectic usually concluded
by finding an impromptu parlour picnic in full swing
at home where rest was sought&ndash;&ndash;finding, too, the full
realization that you not only do not love your
wife but you do not even approve of her.</p>
<p>So he said, quietly: &ldquo;If you wish to make some
radical change regarding your husband would you
mind waiting until he has had a chance at a shower
bath and some breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time in her life the Gorgeous Girl
found herself gathering up Monster, the candy, and
the novel manuscript in her lace-draped arms and
standing outside her husband&rsquo;s firmly closed door.</p>
<p>The shock was so great that she could not squeeze
out a single tear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Mary Faithful felt no regrets at having
told the truth about her love for Steve
O&rsquo;Valley. The regrets were all on Steve&rsquo;s
side of the ledger. Contrary to customary procedure
it was he who practised nonchalance and indifference,
and the office force saw no whit of difference in the
attitude of the president toward his private secretary
or vice versa.</p>
<p>Long ago the force had accepted the attitude of
these two persons as strictly businesslike and their
conception of Mary Faithful was tinged with awe
and a bit of envy at her success. To imagine her
desperately in love with her employer, working for
and with him each day, and finally in extreme desperation
telling the truth as brutally as women sometimes
tell it to women over clandestine cups of tea&ndash;&ndash;was
farthest from their comprehension.</p>
<p>Nor would they have thought it credible that
Steve, married to his coveted fairy princess, should
first become attached to Mary Faithful by friendship
and then find that friendship replaced by a deep
and never-to-be-changed love. It was an impossible
situation, they would have said.</p>
<p>The morning following Beatrice&rsquo;s parlour picnic
and Mary&rsquo;s hard-wrung confession Steve made it a
point to be at his desk when Mary came in, despite
the few hours&rsquo; sleep and the fact that Beatrice had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
willfully chosen to take breakfast with him in sulky,
tearful reproach. When Mary was taking off her
hat and coat he came to the door of her office and
made a formal little bow.</p>
<p>He found himself more in love with her than the
night previous. There was something so pathetic
and lonely about her, successful business woman that
she was; the very fact of people&rsquo;s not suspecting it,
labelling her as self-sufficient and carefree, only
emphasized this loneliness now that he looked at her
with a lover&rsquo;s eyes. He realized that whereas he
had had to win a fortune to marry the Gorgeous Girl
it would be as necessary to lose a fortune to marry
Mary&ndash;&ndash;if such a thing were possible; that she was a
woman not easy to win, one who would find her happiness
not in taking hastily accumulated wealth but
in making a man by slow processes and honourable
methods until he was fitted to obtain a fortune and
then enjoy it with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;wondering if he looked confused&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
wanted to say that I am on the country-club
committee to welcome English golfers, and I&rsquo;ll
be away this week off and on. And&ndash;&ndash;and whenever
you want me to I&rsquo;ll try to keep under cover for a
bit.... I think I do appreciate your telling
me the truth last night more than anything else that
has ever happened to me; there was something so
stoically splendid about it&ndash;&ndash;and I don&rsquo;t want to
abuse the confidence. Please don&rsquo;t mind my just
mentioning it, I&rsquo;ll promise not to do so again; and
we&rsquo;ll go on as before. I was a cad to play about
your fireplace&ndash;&ndash;quite wrong&ndash;&ndash;and you had to make
me realize it. Do you know, I was half afraid you&rsquo;d
send in your resignation this morning? Women always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
do those things in books. Please say something
and help a chap out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was at her desk opening mail with slow,
steady fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my living and Luke&rsquo;s living to make, and
I could not resign unless you asked me to do so,&rdquo;
she told him. &ldquo;I wondered whether or not you
would feel it the thing for me to do. It is a unique
situation,&rdquo; she said in a slightly more animated
tone&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;not the situation, but my calm betrayal of it.
Usually my sort go along in silence and take our
bursts of truthful rebellion on our mothers&rsquo; shoulders
or in sanitariums. I really feel a great deal better
now that I have told you.&rdquo; Her gray eyes were
quite fearless in their honesty as she glanced up.
&ldquo;I feel that I can settle down in an even routine and
be of more service to everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be friends,&rdquo; he urged, impulsively. It
seemed hard not to say foolish, loverish little things,
try to make her believe in miracles, make wild and
impossible rainbow plans, precluding any Gorgeous
Girls and newly remodelled Italian villas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to add a postscript,&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only running true to form, isn&rsquo;t it? Here
it is: If you ever at any time, because you are emotional
and in many ways untried, find yourself unhappy
and at cross purposes, and try to lean on a
sentimental crutch which inclines in my direction&ndash;&ndash;I
shall leave this office just as they do in novels. And
I shall not come back, which they always do in novels.
This would deprive you of a good employee and myself
of a good position and be foolish all round. You
men are no different from us women; once a woman
knows a man loves her she cannot quite hate him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
even if her heart is another&rsquo;s. Instinctively she
labels him as a rainy-day proposition and during some
wild thunderstorm&ndash;&ndash;well, idiotic things happen!
Whereas if she never knew he cared she might go
about finding a mild mission in life. A man is the
same; and since I have trusted you with my secret,
and that secret happens to concern yourself, the
logical consequence is that you will never quite hate
me because I care. In some moods you might even
try telling yourself that you cared, too. Then I
should not only leave your employ but I should stop
caring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on with the morning&rsquo;s mail. Outside, the
office force was stirring. Raps at the door and
phone calls would soon begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you really?&rdquo; he asked, so soberly that
Mary&rsquo;s hands trembled and she blotted ink on her
clean desk pad as she tried to make a memorandum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really. I never can bring myself to believe in
warmed-over magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall never have any such moods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered a phone call and there fell upon the
office an atmosphere of strange peace which had been
missing for many months.</p>
<p>During the winter the rift between Steve and
Beatrice became noticeable even to the Gorgeous
Girl&rsquo;s friends, to Trudy&rsquo;s infinite delight; and by the
time spring came it was an accepted thing that
Steve&rsquo;s share in the scheme of things was to write
checks and occupy as little space as possible in the
apartment, whereas Beatrice&rsquo;s part in the scheme of
things was to badger and nag at her husband eternally
or be frigidly polite and civil, which was far harder
to endure than her temper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>The Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s endeavours to become an advanced
woman, an intellectual patroness and so on,
were amusing and ineffectual. She soon found
neither pleasure nor satisfaction in any of her near-lions.
Nor did she succeed in making them roar.
Whether it was a parlour lecture on Did a Chinese
Monk Visit America a Thousand Years before Columbus?
or a Baby Party at which Beatrice and Gay
dressed as twins and were wheeled about in a white
pram by Trudy, dressed as a French <i>bonne</i>&ndash;&ndash;the reaction
was one of depression and defeat. Though
Beatrice still had her name printed on the reports
of charity committees she no longer took what was
termed an active part. She shrugged her shoulders
carelessly and gave the reason that it was all so hopeless&ndash;&ndash;and
no fun at all.</p>
<p>Inanimate things afforded the most satisfaction;
at least she could buy an individual breakfast service
costing a thousand dollars and have the item recorded
in all the fashion journals, with her photograph, and
she could have the most unique dinner favours and
the smartest frocks, and they never disappointed her.</p>
<p>Besides, the Italian villa was to be finished shortly
and that would necessitate a new round of entertainments
and minor adjustments and no end of
enviable publicity and comment. This diversion
would take her through the late spring and summer,
and in the fall she fully intended to take up dress
reform and become a feminist. She had an idea of
wearing nothing but draped Grecian robes&ndash;&ndash;which
could be made to look quite fetching if one had
enough jewellery to punctuate the drapes&ndash;&ndash;and of
going in for barefoot dancing on the lawn. It
would be more convenient if she could persuade her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
father and aunt not to stay on at the Villa Rosa, as
it was to be called. And certainly it would have
been more &aelig;sthetic to look across the street and see
something besides another expensive and hopelessly
mediocre brick house which another rich man somewhat
after Constantine&rsquo;s own heart had built with
pride and joy. She wished she had bought a site
back from the town and created a real estate. The
fact that she had not done so made her miserable for
over a week, during which Gay consoled her in most
flattering fashion, neglecting his own wife to do so.</p>
<p>Well, after the Villa Rosa&ndash;&ndash;what then? Life
seemed very empty. With a certain natural squareness
of nature Beatrice was not the sort of woman to
indulge in unwise affairs beyond a certain discreet
point. She had never learned how to study, so she
could not become a devotee of some fascinating and
exacting subject. Her really keen mind had merely
skimmed through her studies.</p>
<p>Nor was she over fond of children. As she told
Trudy, children were absorbing things and goodness
knew if she ever had any of her own she would have
a wonderful enough nursery and sun parlour with
panels designed by a child psychologist; there was
everything in first impressions. But take care of
one of them? The actual responsibility? Heavens,
what a fate! She would engage a trained baby
nurse&ndash;&ndash;and then drop in at the nursery for a few
moments each day to see that everything was going
well.</p>
<p>Later, after the trying first years, she would be very
proud of her children. Besides, planning children&rsquo;s
clothes was a great deal of fun; and if she had a
daughter she would see that the daughter married
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
properly. Whether or not she was thinking of Steve,
Trudy did not dare to ask; but she evidently was, as
she added that one might better marry an impoverished
nobleman and live in an atmosphere of culture
and smart society than marry someone who never
attempted to be anything.</p>
<p>A child demanded of one intelligence up to a certain
point, and faithful service, but it did not require
keen intellect. A primitive knowledge of what their
hurt or hunger or plain-temper cry meant&ndash;&ndash;and a
primitive tender fashion of coping with whichever it
might be&ndash;&ndash;were all that young babies demanded;
and hence the Gorgeous Girl, like all finely bred and
thoroughly selfish women of to-day who are bent
on psychological nursery panels, refused to be tied
down to the narrow routine of a nursemaid, as she
called it. Love-gardening is the title old-fashioned
gentlewomen originated.</p>
<p>Then Beatrice cited how carefree Jill Briggs was
with her four children. Goodness knew that Jill
was always within hailing distance of the big time;
and except for a few little illnesses and the fact that
the oldest boy had died of croup the children were a
complete success and perfect darlings, and Jill dressed
them like old-style portraits. Besides, Jill had
tried out a new system of education on the oldest
boy; he had been taught to develop his individuality
to the highest possible degree. At eight, just before
the croup attack&ndash;&ndash;though he did not know his alphabet
or how to tell time and had never been cuddled or
rocked to sleep with nursery jingles as soothing
mental food&ndash;&ndash;he could play quite a shrewd game of
poker and drive a bug roadster. Beatrice, in talking
over the child problem with Trudy, decided that if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
she ever had a son she, too, would develop the poker
shark in him rather than the admirer of Santa Claus
and the student of Mother Goose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Steve thinks a woman should drudge
and slave over those crying mites as if the nation
depended upon it,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;but I should
never pay any attention to him. He said, in front
of Jill, that he always felt well acquainted with rich
children, for he had passed a similar childhood&ndash;&ndash;meaning
that living in an orphan asylum and being
brought up by a nursemaid were much the same
thing. Quite lovely of him, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy could not suppress her giggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the children get on well enough. Just
think, if you had to plan all the meals and dress and
undress them and all the baths&ndash;&ndash;ugh, I never could!
And when Steve begins his eloquent stories about
these nursemaids who neglect children or dope them
or do something dreadful I simply leave the room.
He actually told Mrs. Ostrander that he saw her
nurse slap her child across the face, and proceeded to
add: &lsquo;It is never fair to strike a child that way. It
breeds bad things in him. And he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything;
it was just nurse&rsquo;s day for nerves.&rsquo; Of course
the Ostranders will never forget it. Now, Mrs.
Ostrander is a member of the Mothers&rsquo; Council, and a
dear. She just slaved over her children&rsquo;s nursery and
she reads all their books before she allows the nurse
to read them aloud. I&rsquo;m sure no children were ever
brought up as scientifically; they have a wonderful
schedule. She told me she had never held them except
when they were having their pictures made&ndash;&ndash;never!&ndash;&ndash;and
that crying strengthens the lungs. Of
course Steve says we feed our lap dogs when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
whine but close the door on the baby when he tries it.
So what can you do with such a person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Trudy agreed. Trudy agreed to anything
Beatrice might say until the bills for the villa
were settled and the O&rsquo;Valleys established in the
gondola-endowed home. Trudy sometimes pinched
herself to realize that in such a short space of time
she was living in the Touraine apartment house and
that her husband, whom she loathed more each day,
had actually scrambled into the position of being the
best decorator in Hanover and was busy splitting
commissions and wheedling orders from New York
art dealers and Hanover&rsquo;s social set.</p>
<p>Sometimes Nature takes her own methods of
revenge, and to Mark Constantine&rsquo;s child she saw
fit to send no son or daughter. Constantine never
mentioned his hunger for grandchildren. He had a
strange shyness about admitting the desire and the
plans he had made for them. But when he saw the
completion of this villa and realized the thousands
of dollars squandered upon it and the impossible
existence his daughter would lead living therein he
went to his untouched plain room, looking out on
sunken gardens, to try to figure out how this had all
come about.</p>
<p>He fumbled in mental chaos as to the meaning of
all this nonsense and longed more than ever for a
grandchild, someone who should be quite unspoiled
and who would not approach him with light, begrudged
kisses and a request for money.</p>
<p>The formal Venetian ball which Beatrice gave to
open her new home merely amused Steve, who had
really dreaded it with the hysteria of a schoolgirl.
He hated the whole scheme of the house and the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
who was reaping a rich harvest by engaging the army
of persons who had done the work therein. He rejoiced
openly at each delay on the part of the plumber,
the tinsmith, the decorator; and openly gave a
thanksgiving when the illustrated wall paper for the
halls, which told the legend of Psyche and Cupid,
had been sent to Davy Jones&rsquo;s locker en route from
Florence. Steve&rsquo;s name for the Villa Rosa was the
Fuller Gloom.</p>
<p>But when they did move into the new-old home
and Steve was led through each room of gammon
and spinach, as he had faintly whispered to Mary
Faithful, he found himself only amused. Now that
he considered it, it was a relief to know Beatrice had
such a new and absorbing plaything to take up her
time and keep her aloof from his personal affairs.
He sought out his father-in-law in his plain room
with its walnut set and stand of detective stories,
and sat down in relief, though the two men honourably
refrained from criticizing a certain person
openly.</p>
<p>At the ball Beatrice appeared in a wonderful black
gown, so wonderful and expensive that its creator
had given it a distinct title&ndash;&ndash;The Plume. Steve did
his duty as a handsome figurehead, as someone called
him; after which he was free to stroll in the gardens
and smoke and wonder what manner of folks inhabited
the stars.</p>
<p>An inspection of the house had taken place with
Beatrice and Gay leading the procession, and Aunt
Belle bringing up the rear. The oh&rsquo;s and ah&rsquo;s and
exclamations of approval, resultant of fairy cocktails,
rewarded Beatrice for her expenditure. When she
brought them into her own apartment she stood back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
while Gay lisped out the story of the greatest achievement
and novelty of the entire house, watching the
faces of her guests so as to catch the first expression
of envy which should reveal itself.</p>
<p>The novelty consisted in the set of bedroom furniture,
which, though the rest of the house was Italian,
as Gay hastily explained, was of Chinese workmanship,
carved and inlaid in intricate design&ndash;&ndash;two
dragons fighting over pearls, with the various stages of
the struggle represented on the bed legs, the bureau
drawers, the easy-chair, the dressing table, and so on.
The set had been made for the Emperor of China, but
when his private council inspected it, it was found
that one of the carved dragons on top of the four-poster
bed had captured the pearl for which they
had been fighting in sixty-seven or so other carvings.
This signified bad luck for the emperor; misfortune
and rebellion would be his lot if he slept in the bed.
Though regretting the loss of the furniture the
emperor felt the loss of his kingdom would be even
greater, and the furniture was placed on the market.
To Mrs. Stephen O&rsquo;Valley was awarded the ownership
as well as the privilege of writing the check that
made the purchase possible. On the bed was a pillow
of the material woven for emperors only, thrown
in on account of the ill luck that would attend him
who slept in the bed beneath the conquering dragon;
and on a carved bone platter was an antique Maltese
shawl which gave a rare note to the entire room.</p>
<p>Steve, who had regarded the emperor&rsquo;s rejected
furniture as a cross between a joke and an outrage,
gave way to his feelings by pacing up and down the
hall and capturing a tray of sandwiches being carried
to the supper room. But Beatrice, after Gay&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
speech, felt a rare joy&ndash;&ndash;for every guest in the room
hated her for having won the prize. What more
could she ask by way of reward?</p>
<p>When they were alone in the new-old home Steve
felt it only decent to congratulate her. Somehow
he had come to feel that keeping up sham courtesies
made everything easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have worked very hard, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;But you have wonderful results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so? Everyone hates me now, for
there will never be another royal bedroom set like
mine on the market&ndash;&ndash;when you think that Gay
skirmished about and won it for me, it is quite remarkable.
And it shows what Gay can do when he
has a little encouragement. Alice Twill was almost
cross-eyed and crying; her husband nipped the ch&acirc;teau
idea in the bud. New York men are coming
here to take photographs next week. I wish the
garden were in better shape. They are going to run
feature stories about it.... Oh, Steve, do you
think of any new place to go this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we had just moved to Venice,&rdquo; he said,
still dazed at the amount of carved fire screens,
tapestries, dim, impractical candlelights, and soft-eyed
Madonnas which smiled at him on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have all the office force come and see
this&ndash;&ndash;it would be such a treat. And we can serve
tea on the lawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do. They don&rsquo;t often take time to go to museums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s bad nature was getting the better of polite
resolves. He was thinking of Mary&rsquo;s clear, witty
eyes as she would view the remains of a plain American
house.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>The next thing of interest to keep Beatrice at home
was the advent of a real lion cub, following Monster&rsquo;s
departure to canine heaven. Being too impossible
of shape and disposition for any one&rsquo;s pride or comfort,
Monster was disposed of and buried in a satin-lined
coffin with a neat white headstone telling salient
facts of her short existence.</p>
<p>While Steve was giving devout thanks for the
event Beatrice was realizing that the gardens needed
a dominating note, as Gay said. During her reading
of old fables and romantic legends about superwomen
or extremely wicked matrons she had discovered that
they nearly all possessed a lion or a bear or a brace
of elephants to gambol on the green. Such a pet
symbolized its owner&rsquo;s power and fearlessness, and
any young woman who could have the Emperor of
China&rsquo;s bedroom suite brought post haste into Hanover,
U. S. A., was surely entitled to something in the
jungle line for her front yard!</p>
<p>For the first time in his daughter&rsquo;s life Mark Constantine
made a faint protest, suggesting that she
have a taxidermist mount several lion cubs and group
them about the hall&ndash;&ndash;while Steve sat back in cynical
amusement and asked if she were going to request
the goldfish to step aside in favour of a few Alaska
seals?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she gets a live lion&ndash;&ndash;and she will, because I&rsquo;m
writing to a circus man now,&rdquo; Gay told Trudy&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to sprain my ankle and be laid up from
the day the beast arrives until he goes&ndash;&ndash;he won&rsquo;t
tarry long, the police won&rsquo;t have it. But I&rsquo;m not
going to take any chances. Still, it would never do
to make a fat commission on the deal and then act
as if I were afraid to come over and play cannibal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
with him. I guess you can go,&rdquo; he added, insolently.</p>
<p>Trudy looked at him in scorn. &ldquo;You are cheap,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Well, I will go! I&rsquo;d just as soon be eaten
by a lion as to have to live with a shrimp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lion arrived in due time and was named Tawny
Adonis. Beatrice considered him a perfect love. He
was a gay young cub and quite effective in the new
background, well intentioned but lonesome for his
old atmosphere of circus life and his mother and
brothers. He was given a large run in the Constantine
grounds, and while Aunt Belle stayed locked in
her room the greater share of the time and Gay immediately
sprained his ankle and was forced to send
Trudy as his messenger, Mark Constantine and Steve
found their time well occupied in convincing the
authorities that the town infantry would not be
devoured piecemeal. Hanover had never really approved
of having an Italian villa crammed down its
throat, and it was certainly not agreeable, to say
the least, to have a lion cub at large as a dominating
garden note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot keep him, even if you pulled all his
teeth and taught him to be a dope fiend,&rdquo; Steve said
in desperation after the roars of Tawny Adonis had
been reported to the police as annoying. &ldquo;He is
growing bigger every day and all he has done is demolish
flowers and shrubs and chew up fence posts.
I&rsquo;m sorry for him, and I&rsquo;m not particularly afraid of
him, but if there was an accident with a child even
the owner of a dominating garden note could not expect
to go scot-free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father and her friends championed Steve&rsquo;s
stand in the matter and after a little rebelling and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
pouting and having the pleasure of seeing her name
in all the papers as the owner of the lion cub and so
on, Beatrice consented to part with him on the condition
that she be allowed to give him a farewell birthday
party, he being nearly a year old. She was
going to ask the children of all her friends. But
getting a hint of the event her friends hastily arranged
a Tom Thumb wedding for charity, and then assured
Beatrice it was merely a coincidence that the
two things interfered with each other, wasn&rsquo;t it a
shame? Realizing that this dominating note was not
a social asset Beatrice hastily sided in with her father
and the authorities.</p>
<p>Besides, she was tired of Tawny Adonis; he was
destructive, and a secret source of worry if she could
have been made to admit it. So she prepared for a
birthday f&ecirc;te and determined to have the public-school
children as the guests. But these refused
her invitation as well; so she went into the slums and
collected thirty harmless waifs who felt that a lion&rsquo;s
birthday party was not to be despised, and brought
them triumphantly into the Italian gardens.</p>
<p>The waifs gathered round an outdoor table, too
busy swallowing food to bother about their possible
and likely fate. In the centre of the table was a
huge birthday cake for Tawny Adonis. It was made
of raw hamburger steak, generously iced with bone
marrow, and the single anniversary candle took the
form of a balanced soup bone. After the children
had eaten their fill Tawny Adonis was let loose upon
the scene and at the birthday cake, and during the
wild smashing of glass and china and the excited
shrieks of the waifs Tawny went to the birthday
cake and devoured it, soup bone and all.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>Gay was out of town the day of the party but
Trudy bravely assisted, as did one or two others,
Mark Constantine and his sister sitting in the windows
to watch the procedure while Beatrice in a
gown of turquoise velvet with a coronet of frosted
leaves played Lady Bountiful and dismissed the
slum brigade as soon as possible, sending them home
with the confused knowledge that a beautiful lady in
angel clothes and a wild animal sometimes meant
plenty of ham sandwiches and ice cream, as well as
the opportunity to slip a fork into one&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>Steve declined to take any part in the celebration,
but at the conclusion of the event he appeared with
policemen and a patrol wagon containing a cage, and
amid gay farewells and grim coaxings Tawny Adonis
was escorted to the railway station and shipped back
to the circus man, at a loss of five hundred dollars&ndash;&ndash;not
counting the damage done&ndash;&ndash;to the Gorgeous
Girl!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>Trudy was keen as a brier whenever her own
realm was threatened. With the shrewdness
which caused her to refrain from ever speaking
ill of a woman when talking to a man and never
speaking aught but ill of women when talking to
their own kind, she foresaw in Gay&rsquo;s constant attendance
on the Gorgeous Girl the possibility of an
unpleasant situation.</p>
<p>For the Gorgeous Girl had said not only to her
husband but to her friends that she must find some
other kind of a good time now the novelty of the Villa
Rosa was exhausted. Even inky people bored her,
she added; poets were no longer permitted in her
drawing room, and the circle of pet robins and angel
ducks had somehow wandered out of her safe keeping.
An unusually pretty flock of sweetsome d&eacute;butantes
had thinned the bachelor ranks, and Jill Briggs&rsquo;s
youngest boy died of some childish ailment, disturbing
Beatrice more than she admitted, for some reason,
and making her own thoughts poor company.</p>
<p>It was while she was talking of this child&rsquo;s death
with Trudy that the latter glimpsed the handwriting
on the wall, and with scantily concealed enmity determined
to beat Beatrice at her own game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jill is going away for the winter, poor thing,&rdquo;
Beatrice said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her; it would be too
horrible to have to stay and see all his things about.
And it&rsquo;s the second child she&rsquo;s lost. Goodness me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
she has spent hundreds on baby specialists and
nurses! Well, you know yourself, Trudy&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve
seen how wonderful she has been. This boy&rsquo;s death
has so distressed her that she has decided to have two
nurses stay with the children instead of one. Mighty
sweet of her, as it all comes out of Jill&rsquo;s pocketbook
and not her husband&rsquo;s. She says she cannot think of
leaving them with one person, and she must go away
because her nerves are frazzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is going to the West Indies with an artist
friend, and they are going to make a marvellous collection
of water-colour paintings of birds and flowers,
a sort of memorial to the boy. Jill says she will sell
them and give the proceeds for the <i>cr&egrave;che</i> charity.
Well, that is all very well for Jill to do; she has a real
heartache to live down. But when you have no
earthly reason to go and paint wild birds and flowers
and you are bored to distraction with everything&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning yourself?&rdquo; asked Trudy. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;delighted
that this was so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ever bored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only enough to be fashionable. You see I have
to live Gay&rsquo;s life and career and my own at the same
time.&rdquo; Instinctively Trudy knew this caused envy
in her hostess&rsquo;s heart for a multitude of reasons.
&ldquo;Gay never amounted to anything until we were
married&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she paused for this to take full effect&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
I enjoy playing the game. I have grown fond
of makeshifts and make-believes and hedging, bluffing,
stalling, jumping mental hurdles&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s fun&ndash;&ndash;it
keeps you alive and never weighing more than a
hundred and ten pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy rose to go. She was a <i>chic</i> little vixen in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
fantastic costume of black velvet with a jacket of
blush pink. No one but Trudy could have worn
such a thing&ndash;&ndash;a semi-Dick-Whittington effect&ndash;&ndash;and
have gotten away with it. Though she was physically
very tired from sewing late the night before,
and mal-nourished because she was too indolent to
bother to cook, Trudy looked quite fit for a long
stretch of hard running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you diet seriously?&rdquo; she purred.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only right for your true friends to tell you. The
double chin is permanent, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; She shook
her shapely little head, to Beatrice&rsquo;s inward rage.</p>
<p>As Beatrice sat looking up at this impertinent
little person she suddenly became angered to think
she had ever bothered with an ex-office girl or permitted
Gaylord to coax her into being nice to his
wife. And if this impossible person could bring
Gaylord into the ranks of prosperity in a short time,
making everyone accept her, what couldn&rsquo;t she,
Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley, do with Gay if she tried&ndash;&ndash;seriously
tried? He would not linger beside Trudy if
Beatrice gave him to understand there was a place for
him at her own hearth. She knew Gaylord too
well; he suddenly assumed the figurative form of a
goal, as she had once assumed to Steve&ndash;&ndash;a play pastime&ndash;&ndash;in
the true sense. A real man would not play
off property doll in the hands of any woman, not excepting
his own wife; which Beatrice realized. Living
with a cave man had taught her many things.
Yet it would be rare fun to have a property doll all
one&rsquo;s own, different from the impersonal, harmless
herd of boys and poets, a really innocent pastime if
you considered it in the eyes of man-written law.
What a lark&ndash;&ndash;to switch Gay from this cheap, red-haired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
little woman, dominate his life, suddenly assert
her starved abilities, and make him become far
greater than anything Trudy had ever been able to
do! It would cause such a jolly row and excitement
and pep everyone up. Pet and flatter him and
show Trudy that after all she had only been an
incompetent clerk in Steve&rsquo;s office!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will diet,&rdquo; was all she said, smiling
sweetly. &ldquo;And tell Gay he must come see me to-morrow.
I have a plan that I want to tell him&ndash;&ndash;and
no one else. Besides, there is a flaw in the last pair
of candlesticks he bought for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy realized perfectly well that sweetness from
the lips of an obese lady, after one has assured her
of the arrival of a double chin, always augurs ill for
everyone.</p>
<p>Originally Trudy had determined to use Gaylord
as a stepping-stone, a rather satisfactory first husband.
But since Beatrice&rsquo;s commission to do the
villa and the stream of like orders from the new-rich
who were trying to unload their war fortunes before
they were caught at it, Trudy had grown content
and even keen about Gaylord in an impersonal sense.
She felt that she could not better herself if he continued
to do as well as he had the last few months,
and that she would continue to do her share of hill-climbing
indefinitely. In other words, having won
Gaylord in the remnant department, Trudy decided
to keep him and make him answer the purpose of
paying her board bill.</p>
<p>Besides, though she admitted it only to Mary,
she felt anything but well. The more money Gaylord
made the more he spent on himself, and he
seemed to expect Trudy to manage out of the ozone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
yet to appear as the indulged wife of her enterprising
young husband. It never ended&ndash;&ndash;the eternal
searching for bargains; dyeing clothes and mending,
cleaning, and pressing; living on delicatessen food;
sitting up nights to help out with the work, often
doing odds and ends of sewing, and appearing the
next afternoon in the customer&rsquo;s house to admire
the effect of the new drapery and tell of the bright-eyed
Italian woman who had done the work.</p>
<p>Trudy saw little of Mary. Her better self made
her stay aloof lest she win from her friend other details
to add to her already safeguarded secret. And
she never attempted to amuse Steve. She fought
shy of him when he was about, wisely limiting herself
to shy nods and smiles and occasionally a very
meek compliment, which he usually pretended not
to hear.</p>
<p>As she walked home from the villa&ndash;&ndash;Gay had the
roadster&ndash;&ndash;she told herself that she must watch out or
Beatrice would attempt to spoil Gay to the extent
of making him wish to be rid of his wife. She realized
that Gay was extremely scornful and careless
of her. Having married her and satisfied his one-cylinder
brain that he was a deuce of a chap and
a democratic rake in marrying this dashing nobody
Gaylord turned bully and permitted Trudy to take
the cares of the family on her shoulders. He was
now enjoying the fruits of her industry with a
fair credit rating, very different from formerly, a
bank account of which Trudy knew nothing, and
the congenial work of pussyfooting about boudoirs
and guzzling tea while perched on Beatrice&rsquo;s blue-satin
gondolas.</p>
<p>He no longer needed Trudy. He could see now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
that to be single-handed once more, but with his new
standing and profession, would be a most satisfactory
state of affairs. In fact, if Trudy would only fall in
love with a travelling man and decamp&ndash;&ndash;what a chap
he would soon rise to be! For a broken heart is
often a man&rsquo;s strongest asset and a woman&rsquo;s gravest
suspicion. Trudy, however, gave him no hope in
this direction. She hung about her fireplace contrary
to her former plans concerning it. She really
put in an eighteen-hour day as both slavey and
sylph, and seemed filled with everlasting patience
and jazz.</p>
<p>Coming into the Touraine apartment Trudy
found Gaylord showing old prints to some woman
customers and advising as to the smartness of having
them framed and used in sun parlours or any intriguing
little nook. Trudy was <i>de trop</i>&ndash;&ndash;she was
prettier than the prospective customers, but in their
eyes she had only a Winter-Garden personality&ndash;&ndash;and
Gay frowned his welcome.</p>
<p>Had Trudy not come in Gay would have served
cocktails of his own making, which would cause them
to order the prints at fabulous prices; and then sat
in the dusk talking about the occult and the popularity
of Persian pussy cats and how to make pear-and-cottage-cheese
salad and serve it on cabbage leaves,
which was quite the mode. It never does for an
interior decorator, particularly if specializing in boudoirs,
to have a wife, Gaylord decided as his customers
patronized Trudy and departed, Gaylord
seeing them to their car and standing bareheaded
to wave his bejewelled hand as they whirled round
the corner.</p>
<p>He then returned to give Trudy his unbiassed opinion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
&ldquo;I thought you were going to stay away until
evening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You spoiled the sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? What were you about to do&ndash;&ndash;play soul
mate if they&rsquo;d take the old things? I&rsquo;m the one who
found those prints in a second-hand store and had
sense enough to buy the lot. I&rsquo;m the one who found
the remnants of cretonne you paste them on&ndash;&ndash;and
told you to charge ten dollars each&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m the one
who sits out in the little back room and pastes them
on, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw her purse down with an angry gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the crudest thing,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slapped you once for calling me a crude little
fool&ndash;&ndash;and the next time you try it I&rsquo;ll do better than
that!&rdquo; She was unable to control her temper. &ldquo;If
you think being a bachelor and languishing in this
place would keep you afloat you&rsquo;re mistaken. It&rsquo;s
me&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m the one that buys the bargains and runs
the sewing machine half the night, sends out the bills
and wheedles the salesmen into looking at you&ndash;&ndash;to
say nothing of doing the housekeeping, and keeping
every good-looking woman afraid of me, yet polite.
Why, if you were alone any real business man could
come in here and start a shop and put you behind
the bench overnight. You&rsquo;re nothing! You never
were. You lived on a dead man&rsquo;s reputation until
you married me, and now you&rsquo;re living on a redheaded
girl&rsquo;s nerve. I&rsquo;ll scold as shrilly as I like.
If the neighbours hear, all the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy had lost control of herself. Besides, she
was very tired. &ldquo;Who told you to wear gray-velvet
smocks in your drawing-room shop and to have
soft ties poured down softer collars? You look a
hundred per cent, better than when you hopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
round in a check suit that gave you a gameboard appearance.
I did that. If I&rsquo;d ever worked for
O&rsquo;Valley as I have for you, thinking I&rsquo;d get a good
time out of it somehow, I&rsquo;d have had Mary Faithful
on the run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not add the rest of her ideas&ndash;&ndash;that Beatrice
O&rsquo;Valley, not contented with her store of possessions
and avenues of interests, contemplated playing
property doll with this half-portion little snob who
stood before her in his ridiculous smock costume, half
afraid and half sneering.</p>
<p>The interview concluded with Trudy&rsquo;s going to
the kitchen for some kind of a supper and Gay&rsquo;s
driving off post haste to see Beatrice.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Steve returned from his hurried two-day
trip he asked Beatrice if she realized the amount of
money she was spending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; she answered, aggrievedly.
Steve looked unusually handsome this afternoon,
and seemed to fit into the antique chair; and, in contrast
to her contemplated property doll, Beatrice felt
amiable and willing to play for favour. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
asked you for one quarter of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble&ndash;&ndash;your father has gone on
paying your bills, and you don&rsquo;t seem to realize I
am not an enormously rich man&ndash;&ndash;and never
will be, abnormal business conditions having ceased.
We are back where we started, so to speak, and I
don&rsquo;t look for a time of unheralded prosperity for
some days to come. I was figuring up while I was
away, in detail; and here are the results.&rdquo; He
handed her a memorandum. &ldquo;You see? I earn a
splendid living and I have a neat nest egg not to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
despised. But I have no Italian-villa income. Your
father has, so you came back to your father to take
his money and I am merely a necessary accessory to
the entire ensemble.&rdquo; His voice was bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Stevuns!&rdquo; She was quite the romantic
parasite as she came and knelt beside him in coaxing
attitude. &ldquo;Why, papa wishes me to have everything
I want. He would be terribly worried if he thought
I had to do without a single shoe button!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But must all the shoe buttons be of gold?&rdquo;
Steve interpolated.</p>
<p>She paid no attention to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m papa&rsquo;s only
heir&ndash;&ndash;the money is all mine, anyway, and it always
has been. You know how simple papa&rsquo;s tastes are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like my own&ndash;&ndash;like those of all busy people who
are doing things. We haven&rsquo;t time to pamper ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has to buy up the trash! And you
ought to thank us rich darlings of the gods for existing
at all&ndash;&ndash;we make you look so respectable by contrast.&rdquo;
She waited for his answer.</p>
<p>He rose and went over to the carved mantel, standing
so he could look down the long room crowded with
luxuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this place isn&rsquo;t the home of an American
man and his wife. It&rsquo;s a show place&ndash;&ndash;bought with
your father&rsquo;s money! And I&rsquo;ve failed. I&rsquo;m not
supporting my wife. Good heavens, if I were I&rsquo;d
have to be cracking safes every week-end to do it.
I can&rsquo;t make any more money than I am making&ndash;&ndash;and
stay at large&ndash;&ndash;and you cannot go on living off
your father and being my wife. I won&rsquo;t have it!
I won&rsquo;t be that kind of a failure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do with the money, throw it to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
birds?&rdquo; Her head began to ache, as it always did
when a serious conversation was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until it is yours and then spend it on something
for the good&ndash;&ndash;not the delight&ndash;&ndash;of someone
else, or of a great many other people. Be my wife&ndash;&ndash;let
me take care of you,&rdquo; he begged, earnestly.</p>
<p>Beatrice hesitated. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was her final
answer. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t manage with the allowance
you give me&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t worry, dearest, there&rsquo;s no reason
at all that we shouldn&rsquo;t have as good a time as there
is. Papa wants us to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what I&rsquo;m trying to get at?&rdquo; he
insisted. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you try to see? Just try&ndash;&ndash;put
yourself in my place, make yourself think with my
viewpoint as a starting place. Suppose you had been
a dreamer of a boy with a pirate&rsquo;s daring and a poet&rsquo;s
unreal delusions, and you combined the two to
produce a fortune, a fortune everyone marvelled at,
the lucky turn of the wheel. Suppose you used that
fortune with the same daring and fancy, loving someone
with all your heart, to make money in a regular
business and under the guidance of a well-trained
merchant like your father&ndash;&ndash;and then you married
the person you loved and saw her deliberately belittle
your manhood by going to her father&rsquo;s house
to live, spending her father&rsquo;s money, and leaving you
quite alone and without the joyous and needed responsibility
of supporting your wife. Now what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d start right in spending my own money for
things I wanted,&rdquo; she decided, glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you did not want things&ndash;&ndash;cluttery,
everlasting things, glaring, upholstered, painted,
carved, what not&ndash;&ndash;lugged from the four corners of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
the earth, not harmonizing with your own aims or
interests? Suppose you wanted to create an individual
and representative home and take care of
it and the guardian angel who presided therein&ndash;&ndash;then
what would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;you mean you want another style of house?
Then let&rsquo;s buy a country tract&ndash;&ndash;and I promise to let
you build and furnish just as you wish. That&rsquo;s a
bully idea, dear, to have an abrupt contrast to this
house&ndash;&ndash;old-English manor type would be wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dinner gong brought a merciful release. Beatrice
danced through the archway throwing him a
kiss as the rest of her decision.</p>
<p>It was at this identical moment that Steve concluded
it was too late for his wife ever to develop
anything more than a double chin or so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>During Beatrice&rsquo;s house party, at which
twenty or so equally Gorgeous Girls and
their husbands were quartered in the Villa
Rosa, while a string orchestra danced them further
along the road toward nervous prostration each
night, a fire ignited in the offices of the O&rsquo;Valley
Leather Company.</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s office and Mary&rsquo;s adjoining room were
damaged by water rather than by the slight blaze
itself and during an enforced recess from work both
Mary and Steve found that a fire in an office building
may cause a loss of time from routine yet be a great
personal boon.</p>
<p>The day following the accident, Steve having been
summoned at midnight to view the flames, Mary
came to the office to try to rescue the files and sweep
aside the d&eacute;bris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is really hurt, but they always mess
things up,&rdquo; Steve said, coming to the doorway to
hold up a precious record book. &ldquo;See this? I
wonder why they always leave such a lot of stuff
to clear away. Now the whole extent of damage is
the destroying of that rickety side stairway that is
never used and could have been done away with
long ago. Some boys, playing craps and smoking, left
the makings of the fire and before it touched these
rooms there was water poured into the whole plant.
As a consequence, we have a three-day vacation and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
instead of having the side stairs torn down I&rsquo;m in line
for a chunk of insurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the tea isn&rsquo;t spilled from my caddy,&rdquo; Mary
answered; &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what they used this side stairway for?
It was rickety when I bought the place.&rdquo; He looked
at the blackened remains of steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Mary answered, absent-mindedly.
She could have added that whenever she looked at
those stairs or their closed door she saw but one
thing&ndash;&ndash;Steve on his wedding day as he came stealing
up to ask about the long-distance telephone call,
aglow with happiness and dreams. For her own
reasons, therefore, Mary did not regret the destruction
of the side stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shoved this cabinet over as if they had a
special antagonism to it,&rdquo; he was saying, righting a
small piece of furniture containing mostly Mary&rsquo;s
papers. &ldquo;There&ndash;&ndash;not hurt, is it? Do the drawers
open?&rdquo; He began pulling them out, one after another.
The last refused to open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in this one&ndash;&ndash;it blocks the spring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary tried her hand at it. &ldquo;Something wedged
right at the edge. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see what it can
be. I never used that drawer for anything but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At their combined jerk the drawer came flying
into space, and with it the remains of a white cardboard
box with the monograms of B. C. and S. O.
entwined by means of a cupid and a tiny wreath of
flowers. Dried cake crumbs lay in the bottom of the
drawer. It was the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s box of wedding
cake which Mary Faithful had found on her desk.</p>
<p>Neither spoke immediately. Finally Mary said:
&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s as bad an omen as to break a mirror
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
under a ladder on Friday the thirteenth. Now shall
I have the men sweep the office out? There is no
reason we cannot get to work to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment about sweeping out offices and
going to work,&rdquo; Steve insisted. &ldquo;If you want to
break the hoodoo you have just brought on yourself
by smashing up wedding cake&ndash;&ndash;let me talk and act
as high priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;You promised, and you&rsquo;ve
been true-blue&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t spoil it. Besides, it can do no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask a question,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to break faith with you or take advantage
of knowing what you told me. I shall always try to
appreciate the honour done me, no matter if I am
unworthy. I want to ask a question in as impersonal
a way as if I wrote in to a woman&rsquo;s column.&rdquo; He
tried to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask away.&rdquo; Mary sat down in the nearest
chair, the broken cardboard box at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that a man can honestly be in love
with the woman he marries and yet in an amazingly
short time find himself playing the cad in feeling disappointed,
discontented, utterly lacking affection?
It&rsquo;s a ghastly happening. Why is it he saw no handwriting
on the wall? I am not stupid, Mary, neither
am I given to inconstancy&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve had to struggle too
much not to have my mind made up once and for all
time. Why didn&rsquo;t I see through this veneer of a
good time that these Gorgeous Girls manage to have
painted over their real selves? Why did I never
suspect? And what is a man to do when he discovers
the disillusionment? You see it all, there&rsquo;s no
sense in not admitting it&ndash;&ndash;why do I find myself ill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
at ease, now tense, now irritable over trifles, now
sulky, despondent&ndash;&ndash;as plainly sulky and despondent
as a wild animal successfully caged and labelled, which
must perforce stay put yet which will not afford its
spectators the satisfaction of walking wistfully from
cage corner to cage corner and yowling in unanswered
anguish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; she asked, softly.</p>
<p>He nodded as he continued: &ldquo;I sometimes feel
the way the monkish fraternity did at Oxford when
they claimed &lsquo;they banished God and admitted
women.&rsquo; I want a man-made world, womanless,
without a single trace of romance or a good time.
Not right, is it? Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll crack under
the pretense, go raving mad and scream out the
whole miserable sham under which I live&ndash;&ndash;and every
time I indulge myself in such a reverie I find myself
writing Beatrice an extra check and going with her
to this thing or that, steel-hammer pulses beating at
my forehead and a languor about even the attempt
at breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary would have spoken but he rushed ahead:
&ldquo;I like this fire, this debris. Most people would
curse at it&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s real and rather common, sort of plain
boiled-dinner variety. It gives me an excuse to take
time off from the eternal frolic. I&rsquo;m glad when
there&rsquo;s a strike or a row and I dig out of town to stay
in a commercial hotel. I have to get away from the
whole tinsel show. And yet it was what I wanted,
was willing to play modern Faust to any Wall Street
Mephistopheles&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are sure it wasn&rsquo;t a Mephistopheles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not&ndash;&ndash;for that much I can draw a deep
breath and give thanks&ndash;&ndash;it was my own luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Other times, other titles,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One time you told me what you thought of the
future of American women, the all-round good fellows
of the world&ndash;&ndash;do you remember? I wish you had
not told me. It&rsquo;s just another thing to irritate. I&rsquo;m
driven mad by trifles&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m starved for a big tragedy;
that&rsquo;s the way this craving for a fortune and a good
time is playing boomerang. I&rsquo;m so infernally weary
of hearing about the cut-glass slipper heels of some
chorus girl and so hungry to hear about a shipwreck,
a new creed, a daring crime that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You foolish, funny boy,&rdquo; she said, taking pity on
his involved analysis, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see what you have
done? It&rsquo;s quite the common fate of get-rich-quick
dreamers; you merely symbolized your goal by
Beatrice Constantine, she stood for the combined
relationships of wife, comrade, lady luxury&ndash;&ndash;and you
captured your goal, and the greater effort ceased.
You have had time to examine your prize in microscopic
fashion. It isn&rsquo;t at all what you intended&ndash;&ndash;but
it is quite what you deserve. No one can make
a lie serve for the truth&ndash;&ndash;at all times and for an
indefinite period. There is bound to come a cropper
somewhere&ndash;&ndash;usually where you least expect it. And
you lied to yourself in the beginning, a passive sort of
falsehood, in merely refusing to see the truth and
groping for the unreal. You had to justify your race
for wealth, so you said, &lsquo;Oho, I&rsquo;ll love a story-book
princess and let that be my incentive. Story-book
princesses are expensive lovelies and you have to have
money bags to jingle before their fair selves!&rsquo; So
you became more and more infatuated with the
fairy-book princess who happened to be in your
pathway&ndash;&ndash;and it was Beatrice. She made you feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
that anything your slightly mad and quite unrealizing
young self might do was proper. Just as the boy
with a new air rifle deliberately sets up a target to
shoot away at because the savage in him must justify
hitting something besides the ozone, so you have
merely wooed and won your own falsehood and
disillusionment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it rather neatly; but that isn&rsquo;t all. The
thing is that I&rsquo;m not game enough to go on and take
the punishment. Are you surprised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But are you prepared to give up the thing
which won her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My money? I&rsquo;ve thought of it.&rdquo; He folded
his arms and began walking up and down the littered,
water-soaked office. &ldquo;Would you like me any
better?&rdquo; he asked, tenderly.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes grew stormy. &ldquo;If the men go to
work at once we can have the rugs sent to the
cleaner&rsquo;s and put down old matting for a temporary
covering&ndash;&ndash;and I can go ahead taking inventory,&rdquo;
was her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Steve made himself respond. &ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;I
didn&rsquo;t trespass very much,&rdquo; he whispered as he
passed her to leave the building.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Beatrice regarded the fire as an amusing happening
and before Steve realized what was being done she
had proposed that Gaylord refurnish the office in an
arts-and-crafts fashion. It had long seemed to her
a most inartistic and clumsy place and when Steve
refused her offer and told her that a splint-bottomed
chair and a kitchen chair were his office equipment
some years ago she sent for Gaylord on her own
initiative and told him to beard the lion in the den to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
see if he could win Steve to the cause of painted wall
panels typifying commerce, industry, and such, and
crippled beer steins and so on as artistic wastebaskets.</p>
<p>There had never been an active feud between Gaylord
and Steve; it was always that hidden enmity of a
weak culprit toward a strong man. Neither had
Trudy been able to win Steve by her Titian curls,
baby-blue eyes, and obese compliments. In fact,
Gaylord had avoided Steve the last year. He was
the one Beatrice called upon to play with her, he
accompanied her shopping, even unto the milliner&rsquo;s,
and had been in New York one time when Beatrice
had gone down to see about buying a moleskin wrap.
Not even Trudy knew that he had actually adopted
a monocle and squired Beatrice round in state.</p>
<p>So he approached Steve with the attitude of &ldquo;I hate
you and am only waiting to prove it but meanwhile
I&rsquo;ll play off the friend lizard no matter how painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after a few &ldquo;my dear fellows&rdquo; and &ldquo;old
dears&rdquo; and gibes about the disordered office with its
prosaic chairs and Mary Faithful, quite flushed and
plain looking as she dashed round giving orders,
Gaylord found himself being neatly set outside on
the curbstone and told to remain in that exact
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate this decorating business,&rdquo; Steve said in
final condemnation. &ldquo;I agree with my father-in-law
that when a man approaches me with a book of
sample braids and cretonnes under his arm I feel it
only righteous that he be shot at sunrise&ndash;&ndash;and now
you know how strong you stand with me. I don&rsquo;t
mind Beatrice having her whirl at the thing. A new
colour scheme as often as she has a manicure; that&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
different. But my office stays as I wish it and
you can&rsquo;t rush in any globes of goldfish and inkstands
composed of reclining young females with
their little hands forming the ink cup, while a single
spray of cherry blossoms flourishes over the hook I
hang my hat and coat upon. Oh, no, trot back to
your boudoirs and purr your prettiest, but stop trying
to tackle real men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaylord&rsquo;s one-cylinder brain had become more
efficient by dint of daily sparring with his wife. So
he retorted: &ldquo;She is going to make you a present of
it&ndash;&ndash;your birthday gift, I understand. Does that alter
the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked at him with an even wilder frown.
&ldquo;Tell her to build a bomb-proof pergola for herself
and mark it for me just the same. When we redecorate
round here it takes Miss Faithful about a half
hour to plan the show. Good-bye, Gay, I&rsquo;m awfully
rushed. Thanks just as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gaylord sauntered outside, smiling, apparently as
if he accepted the entire universe. But his one-cylinder
brain harboured an unpleasant secret which
concerned Steve. Gaylord knew that Steve had not
reckoned with his enemies and that he was in no
condition to begin doing so now. Constantine was
no longer at the helm, fearless, respected, and dominating.
Steve was quite the reckless egotist, out of
love with his wife, mentally jaded, and weary of the
game&ndash;&ndash;and his enemies surmised all this in rough
fashion and were making their plans accordingly.
How wonderful it would be if certain catastrophes
did happen. How lucky Beatrice had her own income!
She would never cease ordering bomb-proof
pergolas or bird cages carved from rare woods.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>The next day&ndash;&ndash;before Beatrice and Steve had a
chance to argue the matter out to a fine point&ndash;&ndash;Mark
Constantine had a stroke. It was like the sudden
crashing down of a great oak tree which within had
been hollow and decayed for some time but to all
exterior appearances quite the sturdy monarch.
Without warning he became first a mighty thing
lying day after day on a bed, fussed over and exclaimed
over and prayed over by a multitude of
people. Then he assumed the new and final proportions
of a childish invalid&ndash;&ndash;his fierce, true grasp
of things, his wide-sweeping and ambitious viewpoint
narrowed hastily to the four walls of the sick room.
Instead of the stock-market fluctuation bringing
forth his &ldquo;Gad, that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; or oaths of disapproval,
the taste of an especially good custard or the way the
masseuse neglected his left forearm were cause for
joy or grief.</p>
<p>Life had suddenly changed into the monotonous
and wearing routine of a broken, lonesome old man
who had plenty of time to think of the past with his
wife Hannah, recalling incidents he had not recalled
until this dull, long day arrived. And after reaching
many conclusions about many things Constantine
was forced to realize that no one particularly cared
for or sought out his opinions. He was placed in the
category of all fallen oaks&ndash;&ndash;someone who would have
one of the largest funerals ever held in the city. And
friends murmured that for Bea&rsquo;s sake they hoped it
would not be long.</p>
<p>But it was to be long&ndash;&ndash;for with the tenacity of
purpose he had always exhibited Constantine readjusted
himself to the narrow realm of four walls. His
former tyranny toward the business world was now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
exercised toward his daughter and son-in-law, his
sister and his attendants. He resolved to live&ndash;&ndash;or
exist&ndash;&ndash;just as long as life was possible, to vampire-borrow
from those about him all the vitality that he
could, to have every care and comfort and every new
doctor ever heard of called in to attend him; he now
said he wished to live as many years as God willed.
There was a God, now that he was partially paralyzed,
a very real God, to whom he prayed in orthodox
fashion. He wanted to keep remembering the past
with Hannah, to shed the tears for her death which
he had never taken the time to shed, to decide what it
was that had been so wrong in his life in order that
his death and hereafter might be very properly right.</p>
<p>Aunt Belle had taken this new affliction after
the fashion of a Mrs. Gummidge. It affected her
worse than any one else, first because the ridicule and
fault-finding to which her brother had always treated
her were tripled in their amount and quality, and yet
as she was dependent upon this childishly weak
brother she must endure the treatment. Secondly,
she was reminded that her age was somewhat near
Mark Constantine&rsquo;s age and perhaps a similar fate
lay in store for her. Lastly, it tied her down&ndash;&ndash;propriety
demanded that someone be in the sick room a
share of the time and certainly Beatrice had no
intention of undertaking the responsibility.</p>
<p>Steve had acted as Aunt Belle fancied he would
act, genuinely concerned over the catastrophe and
seeking refuge with this tired old child a greater share
of the time. By degrees Aunt Belle left Steve to play
the role of comforter and companion, since no nurse
ever stayed at the Constantine bedside for longer
than a fortnight. So she was allowed to gambol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
about in her pinafore frocks and high-heeled shoes,
wondering if her brother had made a fair will, taking
into account the fact that a woman is only as old as
she looks&ndash;&ndash;and with a tidy fortune who knows what
might happen after the proper mourning period?</p>
<p>Beatrice had been prostrated at the news. For
two days she stayed in bed and sobbed hysterically.
Then she was prevailed upon to see her father and to
take the sensible attitude of preparing for a long
siege, as Steve suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How cold-hearted it sounds&ndash;&ndash;a long siege!&rdquo; she
reproached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is true. He will not die&ndash;&ndash;he will live until
that splendid vitality of his has been snuffed out by
a careless law of rhythm, so you may as well buck up
and run in to see him every day and then go about
as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sick room drives me wild. I wish I had taken
a course in practical nursing instead of the domestic-science
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think of it. It&rsquo;s like having life-in-death
in the very house. Oh, Steve, can&rsquo;t you
talk him into going to a sanitarium? They&rsquo;d have
so many interesting kinds of baths to try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t mind your parties, if that is what is
bothering you. The only thing he asks is to be left
in peace in his room with plenty of detective stories
and plenty of medical attention, and he won&rsquo;t know if
you dance the roof off. But if you really want to
hasten the end send Gay up there with plans for
remodelling his room&ndash;&ndash;it will either kill or cure,&rdquo; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do something to help me forget and make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
it easier for him,&rdquo; she said, soberly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
try a faith healer&ndash;&ndash;not because I believe in them but
because I don&rsquo;t want to leave any stone unturned. I
think a new interest would help papa. Would you
try adopting a child or my taking up classical dancing
in deadly earnest?&rdquo; She was quite sincere and emotionally
wrought up as she came up to him and laid
her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d take up classical dancing,&rdquo; he advised.</p>
<p>She gave a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s what I really
think would be the best. I will dance on the lawn so
papa can watch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave vent to his father-in-law&rsquo;s favourite
expletive, &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; under his breath.</p>
<p>He did not add what was an unpleasant probability:
that, having to assume full responsibility of affairs,
there were likely to be astonishing complications.
Crashed-down oak trees are quite helpless concerning
their enemies, reckoned upon or otherwise, and
Steve, who had never taken count of his foes, would
be called upon to meet them all single-handed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>In a jewellery store Trudy Vondeplosshe, wrapped
in wine-coloured velours, was coquetting with
diamond rings under glass and trying to affect
an air of indifference concerning them. With all her
husband&rsquo;s rise in the world he did not see fit to bestow
upon his wife any substantial token of his
regard. The vague and transitory idea he once entertained
of playing off fairy godfather to her and placing
a fortune at her feet had become past history.
Now that Gay did run a motor and wear monogrammed
silk shirts he saw to it that Trudy had as
little as the law allowed. She still continued remaking
her dresses and haunting remnant counters,
sewing on Gay&rsquo;s work, playing off the same overstrained,
underfed Trudy as in the first days at the
Graystone apartment. But as it was for a good
time she never thought of faltering.</p>
<p>She had decided, however, that it was time now to
adopt other and more forceful methods of obtaining
the things she craved and felt she had earned. Foremost,
as with many women, was a diamond ring.
After obtaining this she would turn in her wedding
ring for old gold, the price to apply on a platinum circlet
studded with brilliants. For months Trudy&rsquo;s
eyes had glittered greedily as she observed Gay&rsquo;s
clientele with their jewelled bags, rings, brooches,
watches, and what not&ndash;&ndash;yet she possessed not a single
gem.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>She had often enough asked Gay for one, to which
he would sneer: &ldquo;What do you want with a diamond?
You know I&rsquo;m always on the ragged edge of failing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you gamble and drink and are a born
fool,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;You could make real money
if you would listen to me and keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see what that has to do with your wanting
a diamond ring! If I ever make real money you can
have one but not when auto tires are as high as they
are&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when husbands grow tipsy and drive into
ditches and have to be brought home by horses and
wagons. Oh, no. But you&rsquo;ll go shopping with
Beatrice and pick out her jewellery and tell her jewels
have souls and a lot more bunk, and then get a
commission as soon as her back is turned! Why
don&rsquo;t you get me a diamond instead, and omit the
bunk? I&rsquo;ll take one with a flaw&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m used to
seconds. You must believe me when I say that, because
I married you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay no longer feared Trudy; in fact, he felt he had
little use for her. She was an obstacle to his making
an excellent marriage. Through Trudy and all the
rest of the complicated ladder climbing he was now
recognized, and real men were extremely busy these
days getting the tag ends of war-debris business in
shape. It was quite a different situation&ndash;&ndash;he could
have had his choice of several widows. Take it all
in all, he preferred a matron, his days at playing with
debutantes were in the discard. The business of
buying and selling antiques and interior decorating
had so inflated his one-cylinder brain that he really
fancied he needed a mature companionship and
understanding.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a diamond ring, old dear,&rdquo; he said,
lightly, &ldquo;when you have me in a corner, hands
up&ndash;&ndash;so set your wits to work and see what you can
do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was over their hurried breakfast that the discussion
took place, with Trudy, quite a fright in a
tousled boudoir cap and n&eacute;glig&eacute;, scuttling about the
dining room with the breakfast tray and planning
to send out bills, reorder some draperies, and call up
her friends until one of them should offer to take her
to a fashionable morning musical in the near future.
After which she would go down town and make good
at her star act&ndash;&ndash;window wishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me so tired I wonder why I don&rsquo;t clear
out,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m afraid to buy a
diamond ring and charge it to you? Watch me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just try it and see what will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, kind sir.&rdquo; Dropping him a curtsy, Trudy
repaired to do the dishes and swiggle an oil mop about
the floor briefly. Then she burnt some scented powder
and pulled down the window shades. This constituted
getting the establishment in order, the slavey
having gone tootling off on a party some days
before.</p>
<p>Trudy did not refer to the breakfast-table discussion
before she left the apartment. She was dangerously
sweet, and even went into Gay&rsquo;s room, where
he was donning his gray-velvet studio blouse for the
morning&rsquo;s labours. She told him she was quite sure
of securing a fairly good-sized order for some window
shades. Gay did not think it necessary to answer.
He did not glance at her; instead he yawned and
sprinkled toilet water profusely on his pink lawn
handkerchief.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she went her own way.
When she had lingered about the jewellery counter
like a wilful yet not quite wicked child&ndash;&ndash;peering down
at the wonderful, enchanting things which mocked
her empty purse; recalling Gay&rsquo;s first flush of romance
and devotion; her own clever, untiring methods of
pushing him into the front ranks; Mary and Mary&rsquo;s
little secret, so unsafe in Trudy&rsquo;s keeping; Beatrice,
who did not know quite how many rings she possessed;
the whole maddening and really uninteresting
tangle&ndash;&ndash;she wondered if she could force Gay to
buy her a ring. Should she boldly order such-and-such
a stone and pick out a setting and present him
with the bill? Why she hesitated she did not know;
she was like all her wilful sisters who gaze and sigh,
pity themselves, and then steal away to Oriental
shops to appease the hunger by a near-silver ring with
a bulging near-precious stone set in Hoboken style.</p>
<p>This Trudy did not do. For some reason or other
she let her errands go by and took a car to Mary&rsquo;s
office, stopping at the corner to buy her a flower.
Instinctively one connected Mary and flowers as
one associated Beatrice and jewellery.</p>
<p>She found Mary had gone into the old office building
to see about something and that Steve, who
was always as restless as a polar bear when forced
into a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Trudy, was alone in his office.
He was obliged to ask her to sit down and wait for
Mary. Trudy peered curiously about the rooms.
She had never lost that rare sense of triumph&ndash;&ndash;returning
as a fine lady to the very place where she had
once worked for fifteen per. Smiling graciously at
former associates she imagined that she created as
much excitement as Beatrice&rsquo;s visits themselves.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so good to come back here,&rdquo; she began
without mercy.</p>
<p>Steve had to lay aside his work and wonder why
Miss Lunk ever let this creature into his private
domain. He would see that it did not happen twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;I suppose,&rdquo; he knew he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are such a busy man; you don&rsquo;t know how
I admire you.&rdquo; Trudy tried fresh tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um&ndash;&ndash;have you seen the morning papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you but Gay read them to me at breakfast....
You never come to our little home, do
you? Too busy, I presume. Or are you one of
those who can forgive everyone but the interior
decorator?&rdquo; This with an arch expression and a
slight twinkle of the blue eyes&ndash;&ndash;it could not quite
be called a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Mrs. Vondeplosshe. I leave such
things to Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand.&rdquo; Trudy took her cue quickly.
&ldquo;It is out of your province. You can&rsquo;t do big, gigantic
things if you bother with doll-house notions. Now
I really prefer&ndash;&ndash;oh, far prefer&ndash;&ndash;men like yourself,
who&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve started the electric fan whirring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever long for camping trips or long
horseback rides&ndash;&ndash;something away from the everlasting
fuss and feathers? I do. Would you believe it?&rdquo;
she fibbed glibly.</p>
<p>Had Steve been seventy-five he might have believed
her. But he merely nodded and said that if
there was a draft from the fan she could sit outside.</p>
<p>Piqued, Trudy turned to Mary Faithful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary is a wonderful girl, isn&rsquo;t she? Of course
you have a Gorgeous Girl, too&ndash;&ndash;but she is for playtime.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
I should think it would mean a great deal to
have Mary for your chief confidante&ndash;&ndash;she is so good,
and yet human and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve stood up abruptly and wondered why no
kind friend saw fit to enter at this moment. He
would have really welcomed Trudy&rsquo;s husband. He
looked at Trudy briefly, it did not take Steve long
these days to look at Gorgeous Girls and Gorgeous
Girl seconds and realize the whole story of their purpose
and struggle&ndash;&ndash;things, to have more gayly coloured
or delicate coloured, gold, silver, velvet, carved,
perfumed or whatever-the-mode-dictated things,
flaunting these priceless sticks and stones in each
other&rsquo;s faces with pretended friendship.</p>
<p>He did not answer this last lead at conversation,
but, not discouraged, Trudy went on down the list of
her resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is dear old Mr. Constantine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo; Steve thanked fortune his father-in-law
was paralyzed and could furnish a neutral topic
of debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear. So hard for Bea, too. She says she
will not do much this season. She feels if&ndash;&ndash;if it
should not be much longer, you understand&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a
lowered tone of voice and a sigh&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that she wants
to have nothing on her conscience. Still, a sick room
is wearing, but of course love makes any task easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve suppressed a smile. It was surprising how
well this funny little person managed to ape the
jargon and chatter of Bea&rsquo;s set as well as their mode
of appearance. She did it mightily well, everything
considered, and when she proceeded to offer to go and
sit with the old dear or bring her game board and play
with him Steve released a broad grin as he pictured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Constantine in his helpless captive state welcoming
Trudy as an entertainer about as much as he would
have begged for a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with a lady major bent
on conquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would even marry him if she could dispose of
Gay,&rdquo; he thought, and rightly, as he watched her.</p>
<p>As she was telling him of the head-dress party she
intended to give for Gay&rsquo;s birthday and how he must
come because she wanted him to wear a pirate turban,
in came Mary, much flurried over a mistake
made in a shipment, and her nose guilty of a slight
but unmistakable shine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Trudy! Run home&ndash;&ndash;your house is on fire!
Your cretonnes will burn!&rdquo; she said, half in earnest.
&ldquo;My dear child, I&rsquo;m mighty busy. It is so stupid of
Parker!&rdquo; She turned to Steve. &ldquo;He made the
original error and I have to keep cross-examining
everyone else to prove to him that I know he is at
fault and that he must &rsquo;fess up. But he won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;people
never want to say: &lsquo;Yes, it is my fault and I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rsquo; do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of habit since the Garden of Eden, I guess&ndash;&ndash;you
can&rsquo;t expect it to change now.&rdquo; Steve had lost
his listless air. All unconsciously he had the same
animated, interested attitude that he had had during
the days of being engaged to the Gorgeous Girl. Trudy
saw at a glance that Mary had not only realized
her starved hopes but that she was quite ignorant
of the fact that she had done so. To Trudy&rsquo;s mind
it was a most stupid situation; also an inexcusable one.
Here was Mary, the good-looking thing who deserved
a love such as Steve O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s yet never dared to
hope he would ever think of her twice except if she
asked for a raise in salary. This Trudy knew, also.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
And since it is inevitable that a cave man cannot
exist on truffles, chiffon frocks that must not be
rumpled, and an interior decorator with a ukulele at
his beck and call, Steve had been forced into realizing
Mary&rsquo;s worth and loving her for it, giving to her the
mature and steady love of a strong man who, like
Parker, had made a mistake and not yet &rsquo;fessed up.
Why Mary did not realize that happiness was within
her reach, and why Steve did not realize that Mary
adored him, and why they were not in the throes of
talking over her lawyer and my lawyer and alimony
but we love each other and let the whole world go
hang&ndash;&ndash;was not within Trudy&rsquo;s jurisdiction to determine.
She only knew what she would have done
and be doing were she Mary&ndash;&ndash;and Steve O&rsquo;Valley
loved her.</p>
<p>She felt the situation was as unforgivable and
stupid as to have Gay offer her a two-carat diamond
ring and to have her say: &ldquo;No, Bubseley; sell it and
let us use the money to start a fund for heating the
huts of aged and infirm Eskimos. The Salvation
Army has never dropped up that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great miracle had happened. And, envying
Mary a trifle and pitying Steve for not having won
his cause, Trudy justified a hidden resolve of long
ago: To use Mary&rsquo;s secret in case Beatrice became
overbearing or impossible. It was mighty fine
plunder, upon which she flattered herself she had a
single-handed option.</p>
<p>So she released Steve from the agony of conversation,
and watching the tender, happy look as he talked
to Mary over some other detail of the cropper, she
went inside to Mary&rsquo;s office to powder her own little
nose and realize that she was no nearer to obtaining a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
diamond ring than when she first began to crave for
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bundle you off,&rdquo; Mary informed her.
&ldquo;I really must&ndash;&ndash;or was it anything special?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all Trudy could do not to offer to play the
confidential bosom friend and urge Mary to show
Beatrice where she stood. But somehow the brisk
business atmosphere, which was very real and
brusque, prevented her from saying anything except
that she had wanted to talk to her. She was lonesome&ndash;&ndash;she
was going to come some evening and
have a good, old-time visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&ndash;&ndash;just let me know when.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;archly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;are you busy on certain evenings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. French lessons; theatre; general
odd jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No particular caller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mary laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps&ndash;&ndash;you know, one time I came
in and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came one time and found Mr. O&rsquo;Valley,&rdquo;
Mary hastened to add. &ldquo;Yes, I remember, but that
was an unusual occurrence. He came in on business
and when he discovered I did not object to a pipe&ndash;&ndash;he
stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy was disappointed. &ldquo;Did Beatrice ever
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know myself.&rdquo; Mary was determined to
win out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why she should&ndash;&ndash;it would not
interest her. She never listens to things that do not
interest her.... You won&rsquo;t know Luke. He
grows like a weed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy found herself dismissed. She did not know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
just how it had come about but Mary was smiling
her into the elevator and Trudy was sinking to the
ground floor feeling that though it was none of her
business unless she got a diamond ring she was just
going to make other people unhappy, too.</p>
<p>Why this conclusion was reached was not at all
clear to Trudy any more than to the rest of the world.
But after all, it is only fair to leave something for the
psychologists to debate about. At all events, it was
the definite conclusion at which she arrived.</p>
<p>She could not resist paying a fleeting return visit
to the largest of the jewellery stores. After which she
told herself that it was little short of going without
shoes or stockings through the streets to have been
married the length of time she had been married and
to possess not a single diamond.</p>
<p>Returning home for a canned luncheon she discovered
Gaylord humming a love song and strumming
on his ukulele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, old dear,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have had the greatest
luck! I call it nothing short of a fairy tale.&rdquo;
He pointed at his neckscarf. Coming near, Trudy
bent over and gave way to a shrill scream. A handsome
diamond pin reposed in the old-rose silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&ndash;&ndash;where did you get it?&rdquo; she managed to
articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beatrice really&ndash;&ndash;the result of the raffle for the
children&rsquo;s charity. You remember we took tickets?
She donated this scarfpin, and this morning Jill
Briggs came in and presented the trophy. My
number was the winning one: 56.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made you win it. You know she did, you
toadying little abomination! You fairly lick her
boots&ndash;&ndash;and she has to tip you occasionally. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
you sit there wearing that pin and never offering to
have it set in a pin for me. You dare to keep it&ndash;&ndash;you
dare?&rdquo; She lost her self-control.</p>
<p>Gay sprang up in alarm, the ukulele being the only
weapon handy, holding her off at arm&rsquo;s length. &ldquo;How
low!&rdquo; he chattered. &ldquo;How d-disgustingly low&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? I&rsquo;ll show you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll show you whether or
not you can wear diamond stickpins while I have to
endure a wedding ring like a washwoman&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Gay knew what was happening Trudy had
left the house. A half hour later a suave clerk&rsquo;s
voice from the jewellery store was asking him to step
down at once, his wife had requested it, she had
decided on a ring for herself but wished his seal of
approval&ndash;&ndash;so did the store&ndash;&ndash;and a small deposit&ndash;&ndash;would
he be able to be with them shortly?</p>
<p>He would, struggling with a man-size rage. After
all, the little five-eighths-carat stone he had so proudly
adorned his bosom with would be dearly paid for in
the end. That was what came of marrying beneath
him, he reproached himself as he locked up the apartment
and went down to the store. To make a scene
in a fifty-cent caf&eacute; was not worth the effort, Trudy
had once proclaimed, but to run the gauntlet of real
rough-house emotion in a jewellery store frequented
by his clientele would be social suicide. The only
thing was to make Beatrice pay a larger commission
on the things for her new tea house so that he could
pay for this red-haired vixen&rsquo;s ring. But this would
not in the least dim the red-haired vixen&rsquo;s triumph,
which was the issue at stake. From that moment
he began really to hate Trudy.</p>
<p>To her amazement he greeted her in honeyed tones,
approved the ring, and suggested that the wedding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
ring be turned in for old gold and replaced by a
modern creation and so on, produced a deposit, and
walked out with Trudy, who wore the new symbol
of triumph on her finger, proposing that they lunch
downtown. He was determined to carry it through
without a moment&rsquo;s faltering.</p>
<p>Even Trudy was nonplussed. Once the treasure
was secure in her possession she told herself it had
been so easy that she was a fool not to have tried it
before&ndash;&ndash;she even complimented Gay on his scarfpin.
But she began hating him also. No one would have
suspected it, to watch these diamond-adorned young
people guzzling crab-meat cocktails and planning
fiercer raids on Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s pocketbook.</p>
<p>Moreover, Trudy did not change in her decision to
make someone unhappy. She found that possessing
a diamond ring did not remove her discontent&ndash;&ndash;and a
shamed feeling stole over her, causing her to wonder
how loudly she had screamed at Gay and how she
must have looked when she started to strike him in her
blind rage; how horrible it was to go off on tangents
just because you wanted rings on your fingers and
bells on your toes when all the time the world did
contain such persons as Mary Faithful, who did
not choose to claim a paradise which longed to be
claimed.</p>
<p>Trudy was unable to keep her fingers out of the
pie. She found herself naturally gravitating over to
see Beatrice. Ostensibly she wanted to display her
new ring and talk about Gay&rsquo;s luck and the daring
gypsy embroideries he had just received from New
York but really to tell her Steve O&rsquo;Valley, supposedly
enslaved cave man, loved another and a plainer
woman than her own gorgeous self.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>She found Beatrice in a n&eacute;glig&eacute; of delicately embroidered
chiffon with luxurious black-satin flowers
as a corsage. She had seldom seen her look as lovely;
even the too-abundant curves of flesh were concealed
behind the lace draperies. She seemed this day of
days to fit into the background of the villa, as if some
old master had let his most adored brain child come
tripping from a tarnished frame&ndash;&ndash;a little lady in old
lace, as it were.</p>
<p>Beatrice had taken up a new activity since her
father&rsquo;s stroke. At first the stroke had frightened,
then bored, then amused her. She really liked
having what she termed a &ldquo;comfortable calamity&rdquo; in
the family. It was something so new to plan for and
talk about, such a valid excuse if she did not wish to
accept invitations, and an excellent reason for runaway
trips to Atlantic City or New York &ldquo;to get
away from it all for a little&ndash;&ndash;poor, dear papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she sat with her father rather more than one
would have expected, made him listen to opera
records which drove him to distraction, talked to
him of nothing, and tried to be a little sister to the
afflicted in a pink-satin and cream-lace setting.</p>
<p>She had lost her interest in Trudy&ndash;&ndash;Trudy no
longer amused or frightened her. And Gay had
become so useful and attentive that had the truth
about the raffle been known it would be the astonishing
information that as Beatrice donated the tie
pin she decided she should pick the future owner&ndash;&ndash;and
Gay was the logical candidate to her way of
thinking.</p>
<p>Also she was quite contented with Steve. He let
her alone and he adored her&ndash;&ndash;she never doubted that.
He wanted her to have everything she wished&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
that was the biggest, finest way to show one&rsquo;s love
for another. It was the only way that she had ever
known existed. Of course all brides have silly notions
of perpetual adoration, that sort of thing, and
Steve was a cave man first and last, bless his old
heart, but they had passed any mid-channel which
might exist and were happy for all time to come.
They seldom quarrelled, and she no longer tried to
make Steve over to her liking in small ways, and he
seldom offered her suggestions. Moreover, he was so
good to her father&ndash;&ndash;and of course everything was as
it should be. It was simply the rather drab fashion
in which most lives are lived, and Beatrice was quite
contented. She had never gotten another toy dog,
not even as a contrast to Tawny Adonis. Really,
Gay answered a multitude of needs!</p>
<p>But Trudy was a real person&ndash;&ndash;and a constant reminder
of what Beatrice herself might have been, and
therefore Beatrice never ceased to envy her or to
picture how much better she could do were she in
Trudy&rsquo;s place. She preferred not having her about.
Besides, Trudy was impossible in Italian villas&ndash;&ndash;she
belonged in a near-mahogany atmosphere with
cerise-silk drapes and gaudy vases. Age-old elegancies
did not harmonize with her vivid self.</p>
<p>So she was not overly cordial in greeting Trudy.
But Trudy with an eye to mischief managed to draw
her little lady-in-old-lace hostess into a heart-to-heart
talk. And before the afternoon ended Beatrice
had experienced the first real shock of her life. Her
husband smoked a pipe in Mary Faithful&rsquo;s living
room and never told her; and Mary Faithful admitted
she loved someone very much and was with
him each day in business and so on; and Trudy had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
seen the smile pass between them which signifies the
perfect understanding! And oh, she did not know a
tenth of it, deary; not a tenth of it! It was one of
those subtle, hidden things, nothing tangible or
dreadful&ndash;&ndash;like a purgatorial state of mind which may
result in brimstone or lovely angels with harps.
Neither could she do anything about it since they
were both perfect dears and always would be. Not
for worlds, in Trudy&rsquo;s estimation, would they ever
take it upon themselves to prove the brittleness of
vows.</p>
<p>After which Beatrice thanked Trudy, wishing her
a speedy death by way of gratitude, going to her
room to decide what her attitude should be.</p>
<p>To accuse Steve was crude; besides, she must be
positive that it was true. To get up an affair herself
would be no heart balm since she had never ceased
having affairs&ndash;&ndash;well-bred episodes, rather, perfectly
harmless when all is said and done, quite like Steve&rsquo;s,
for that matter! She could not find a new interest in
life until she had reduced at least twenty pounds,
since her dieting and exercises required all surplus
will power and thought. She would go away only
her plans were made for months ahead. She could
not tell her father&ndash;&ndash;the shock might kill him....
There was really nothing left to do but suffer&ndash;&ndash;be
wretched and wonder if it was true. A horrid state
of uncertainty&ndash;&ndash;to ask herself how it could ever have
happened and what would be the end, and terrible
things&ndash;&ndash;just terrible things! No matter how large a
check she might write to buy herself a new toy it
would have no bearing whatsoever upon the matter.
She wished to heaven Trudy had confined her gossip
to the funny little manicure with champagne eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
who flirted with someone else&rsquo;s husband! This was
her reward for having taken up with a shopgirl
person!</p>
<p>The final conclusion she reached was that she did
not believe a word Trudy had told her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Beatrice took occasion to go to see Mary
within the next few days. In a particularly
fetching costume of green satin with fly-away
sleeves steadied by silver tassels and a black hat
aglow with iridescent plumes she surprised Mary at
an hour when Steve would be absent. On this occasion
Beatrice dressed to dazzle and intimidate one of
her own sex. But the result was unsatisfactory.
She found Mary quite passable in cloud-blue organdie,
a contented look in her gray eyes.</p>
<p>Her own satin costume and plumed bonnet
seemed a trifle theatrical. She wished she had worn
her trimmest tailored effect to impress upon this tall
young woman that no one else could wear tailor
things so well as Mrs. Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley if she chose
to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley?&rdquo; Mary said,
almost patronizingly, Beatrice fancied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in to say hello. I&rsquo;ve neglected you lately.
But you have been so horrid about not coming to
see my gardens that you deserve to be neglected.&rdquo;
Her dove-coloured eyes watched Mary closely. &ldquo;Besides,
I want to get something for Mr. O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s
desk&ndash;&ndash;as a surprise. You must help me because, as
I have realized, you know so much more about him
than I do.... There, am I not generous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo; Mary surmised that something of
greater importance lay behind the call than showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
off the satin costume or selecting a surprise for
Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suggest? I&rsquo;m such a frivolous
person my husband never tells me his affairs or
wishes. The rugs might be in rags and he would
never ask me to replenish. I understand now so
much more clearly than ever before why business
men and women are prone to fall in love with each
other; they see each other so constantly under tests
of each one&rsquo;s abilities. They have to ask each other
favours and grant them. Sometimes it is a loan of a
pencil sharpener, more often it must be the aid of the
other fellow&rsquo;s brain to help solve a problem. And
they are so shut away from my world. I&rsquo;m just the
pretty mischief-maker who squanders the dollars,
and by and by, when self-pity sets in, they find there
is a mutual bond of admiration and sympathy.
Quite a step toward love, isn&rsquo;t it? As I came in here
to-day I could not help thinking of how beautifully
you keep business house for my husband. Why,
Mary Faithful, aren&rsquo;t you afraid I am going to be
jealous?&rdquo; She was laughing, but the intention was
to have the laugh blow away and the sting of the
truth remain.</p>
<p>Mary knew this&ndash;&ndash;and Beatrice knew that she did.
So trying to make herself as formidable as a bunch of
nettles Mary took heed to answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have been reading novels&ndash;&ndash;the
ones where the business woman grows paler and more
interesting looking each day and somehow happens to
be wearing a tempting little chiffon frock when the
firm fails and the young and handsome junior partner
takes refuge in her office and proceeds to brandish
a gun and say farewell to the world. You see, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
don&rsquo;t come down to play with us enough to know
what prosaic rows there are over pencil sharpeners
or who has spirited away the drinking cup or why the
window must be six inches from the top because So-and-so
has muscular rheumatism. I don&rsquo;t think
you are fair, Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley, and I&rsquo;m going to risk
being quite unpopular by telling you that you have
no right to say such things even in jest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s eyes were very honest and her face seemed
even firmer of chin as she leaned her elbows on her
desk, looking up at this pretty figurine in satin and
plumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fancy it is any fun to go to work at thirteen
or fourteen? To rush through breakfast to
stand in a crowded car, to have to make your heart
very small as the Chinese say, in order to appreciate
the pennies and keep them until they become dollars&ndash;&ndash;when
all of you longs to play Lady Bountiful? To
rub elbows with untruthful mischief-makers, coarse-mouthed
foremen, impossible young fools who wish
to flirt with you and whom you do not dare to rebuke
too sharply; to take your hurried noon hour with little
food and less fresh air and come back to the daily
grind; to walk home or hang on to the tag end of a
street-car strap and finally get to your room or your
home so tired in body and mind that you wish you
had no soul, protesting faintly against girls and
women having to be in business?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think you do realize. Or to run errands
icy-cold days, down slushy streets or slippery
hills? To carry great bundles of such daintiness as
you are wearing and leave them at the doors of big
houses such as your own, numbed, hungry, envious&ndash;&ndash;and
not understanding the wherefore of it? To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
catch glimpses of warm halls, the sound of a piano
playing in a flower-scented salon, to see girls your
own age in dainty silk dresses sitting in the window
and looking at you curiously as you go down the
steps? Oh, I could tell you a great deal more, Mrs.
O&rsquo;Valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually some of us survive and some do not&ndash;&ndash;which
is another story! Those of us who do, who
endure such days that we may go to night school, and
who wear mended gloves and queer hats, forgoing
the cheap joys of our associates&ndash;&ndash;we do forge ahead
and grow grimmer of heart and graver of soul. We
realize that we are earning everything we are getting&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
more&ndash;&ndash;only we cannot get the recognition
we deserve. We are quite different from what you
stay-at-home women fancy. Tempting chiffon
frocks and love affairs de luxe with handsome junior
partners are farthest from our thoughts. We plan
for lonely old age&ndash;&ndash;a home and an annuity, a trip
to Europe or some other Carcassonne of our thwarted
selves. We revel in things as you women do&ndash;&ndash;but
we revel in them because people are shut away from
us. You women shut away people that you may
revel in things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time the handsome junior partners and
so on for whom we keep business house and through
propinquity are supposed to love&ndash;&ndash;they have fallen
in love with sheltered girls such as your own self, and
everything is quite as it ought to be. Now do you
really think the capable business women of to-day
are letting their abilities be spent in useless rebellion
against their fate and loving the members of the
firm in Victorian fashion or doing their work intelligently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
and earning their wage? I hardly think
there is room for an argument. You must understand
that the years of errand girl, night school,
underpaid clerk have taken out of us a certain capacity
for enjoyment which you women have had
emphasized. But thank God it has also taken from
us a capacity for hysterical suffering, for going on
the rocks when we see some joy we crave yet know
can never be ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Beatrice murmured, wishing Steve would
come in or else Mary be called to the telephone.
&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do think there is a certain justice developed
among modern business women which home women
do not comprehend as a rule. Oh, not that I underestimate
the home women or the sheltered women.
There is a distinction between the two&ndash;&ndash;but I say
that the business woman who earns a man&rsquo;s wage
and does his work has a certain squareness, for want
of a better term, which makes her say, &lsquo;If I earn
something it is mine and I shall not hesitate thus
to label it. Look out&ndash;&ndash;any one who tries to take it
from me!&rsquo; Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary paused, annoyed at what she had been prevailed
upon to say, and wondering if by good fortune
her opinions had been delivered to empty ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think you would fight for something to
which you felt entitled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo; The gray eyes had a warrior&rsquo;s
strength in them. &ldquo;Fight, win it, and then spend
no time in sentimental regrets. We learn one thing
that all women should learn in this great age of selection:
That you must earn the things you win, and
that if you do so you will most likely keep them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And if you felt that you had earned something&ndash;&ndash;and
another woman had not&ndash;&ndash;you would play off
the conqueror and take the spoils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I felt it the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling as confused as a bank cashier when caught
studying a railroad map Mary hastened to suggest
a picture of Beatrice handsomely framed as a surprise
for Steve. She was sure he would like nothing any
better.</p>
<p>Beatrice felt chirked up upon hearing this. She
told herself that Trudy was an inveterate gossip and
this queer young person must be thinking aloud
about revolutions in Russia or something like that;
anything else was too absurd. So she repeated her
invitation to come to see the gardens with their jewel-like
pools and riotous masses of colour, and went
on her way to select a most gorgeous frame for a
most gorgeous portrait of herself.</p>
<p>Steve expressed his thanks for the surprise picture
quite properly, and after giving it a few days of prominence
on his desk he relegated it to a shelf beside a
weather-beaten map of the Great Lakes which had
always been in the office.</p>
<p>And here another phase of the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s
effort to do something and exercise her faculties occurred.
Though she regarded Trudy&rsquo;s gossip as absurd
she did not forget it. No woman would. It
lay in waiting until the right moment.</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s illness and Steve&rsquo;s worried look as he
came home each night caused Beatrice to cast about
for something noble and remarkable to do. The
conclusion she reached was that it was her duty to
retrench; she was not going to have floor-scrubbing
duchesses corner all the economy feats. She would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
make it the mode to live simply, even be penurious
in some ways&ndash;&ndash;now that she had the Villa Rosa and a
season&rsquo;s budget of frocks. She began looking over
the monthly bills in deadly earnest. The result was
a blinding headache which prevented her going in to
see her father. She retired to her room in cream lace
with endless strings of coral, and left word for Steve
to drop in on his way to his own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deary, I&rsquo;ve been too extravagant,&rdquo; she began
faintly as he opened the door. She reached out her
hand to find his.</p>
<p>He brought a chair over beside the chaise-longue
and sat down obediently, holding the small, fragrant
fingers in his own. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be mighty glad if you felt
you could live more simply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You duck! Just what I&rsquo;m about to do. I&rsquo;m
going to be the loveliest Queen Calico you ever did
see&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve no doubt but what I&rsquo;ll be making you a
beefsteak pudding before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve smiled. &ldquo;Who will take this castle of gloom
from under us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! We may as well stay here&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t mean
that sort of retrenching&ndash;&ndash;I mean in other ways. I&rsquo;m
not going to give expensive bridge parties or keep
three motors and a saddle horse&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t ride any
more, anyway&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m not going to have a professional
reader for papa. Aunt Belle, you, and I can
manage that&ndash;&ndash;that will take fifteen dollars a week
from the expenses. Besides, I am going to have
three-course dinners from now on&ndash;&ndash;no game, fish,
or extra sweet. That will make a difference&ndash;&ndash;in
time. I shall not buy the new dinner set I had halfway
ordered&ndash;&ndash;it was wonderful, of course, but I have
no right to use money for nonsense. Papa can give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
it to me for my birthday if he wants to. Gifts don&rsquo;t
count, do they, Stevuns?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is the servant question. Now cook
is seventy-five dollars a month; the three maids are
fifty each, besides all they steal and waste; the laundress
and her helper, the chauffeur and all the garden
men; the food, light, heat&ndash;&ndash;to say nothing of extra
expenses; my parties and trips and the enormous
bills for taxes and upkeep that papa pays&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
afraid to say how much it comes to each month. But
it is going to stop! Then my clothes&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m just
ashamed to think&ndash;&ndash;while you, poor dear, exist on
nothing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh, thank you, Elsie.&rdquo; A maid had
brought in a supper tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to come downstairs, so I sent for
some lunch.&rdquo; She watched Steve&rsquo;s amused expression.
&ldquo;Aunt Belle gets on my nerves and unless we
are having people in, the room is too big to have a
family meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the tray was a dish heaped with tartlettes aux
fruits, cornets &agrave; la cr&egrave;me, babas au rhum, petits
fours, madeleines, and Napol&eacute;ons. There was another
dish filled with marrons glac&eacute;s and malaga
grapes preserved in sugar. A few faint wedges of
bread and butter pointed the way to the pot of iced
chocolate and the pitcher of whipped cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Steve ventured, looking at the tray, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I don&rsquo;t agree&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your ideas. You think I ought to be
frying chops for you and giving praise because I have
a nineteen-dollar near-taffeta dress. I can just see
you walking round a two-by-four back yard measuring
the corn and putting the watermelons into eiderdown
sleeping bags so they won&rsquo;t freeze; then telling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
everyone at the shop what an ideal home life you
lead! No, deary, I&rsquo;m retrenching because it&rsquo;s a
novelty, and you would like to retrench&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I may be forced to do so. I hate
to worry you&ndash;&ndash;I never mean to unless there is no
other way out&ndash;&ndash;but I must warn you that the abnormal
war conditions are no longer inflating business
and everyone is watching his step. I cannot take
your father&rsquo;s place; he carved it out step by step. I
fairly aeroplaned to the top and found that while
I was sitting there in fancied security other people
were busy chopping down the steps and I should find
myself having a great old fall down to earth.
Now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any more things,&rdquo; she murmured, deep
in a fruit tart. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand. You are a big,
strong man. Go keep your fortune; let me play.
I&rsquo;ll retrench for fun, and you must love me for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not sincere,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t earn anything. You don&rsquo;t save anything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice sat upright, laying aside her plate and
fork. &ldquo;So you believe that, too,&rdquo; she half whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; Steve added, in desperation. &ldquo;I
wish we were back in the apartment&ndash;&ndash;or a simple
house. I wish we kept a cook and a maid and you
had a simple outfit of clothes and a simple routine.
I wish we were just folks&ndash;&ndash;you know the sort&ndash;&ndash;you
don&rsquo;t find them any place else but America&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
a tremendous chance to be just folks if you would
only realize. I feel as if this were a soap-bubble
castle, as if we were deliberately playing a wrong
game all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell papa,&rdquo; she begged; &ldquo;and if he thinks I&rsquo;m
unhappy he will write me another check.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the retrenching is to be the elimination of
the fifteen-dollar-a-week professional reader, who
needs the work and earns the money, and two courses
from our already aldermanic meals? What else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall send the silver to the bank and use plate.
The smartest people do that. I shall make aunty
embroider my monograms; she can as well as not&ndash;&ndash;the
last were frightfully expensive. I&rsquo;m going to
bargain sales after this, and take cook and drive out
to the Polish market. Why, things are two and
three cents a pound cheaper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve rose abruptly, tipping over the dainty chair
as he did so. He tried to straighten out the pinky
rug and set the chair properly upon it. Then he
squared off his shoulders and dutifully stooped to
kiss his economical little helpmate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, darling,&rdquo; he said, glibly, feeling that
Gorgeous Girls were get-rich-quick men&rsquo;s albatrosses,
&ldquo;that will be very amusing for you. It will tide
you over until the horse-show season. Now if you
don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;m going below to ask what the chances
are for some roast beef!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward Christmas, when Beatrice had gone to
New York with friends and Mark Constantine discovered
that dying is ever so much harder than death,
Mary told Steve that she was considering a new position,
with a firm dealing in fabrics, a firm of old and
honourable reputation.</p>
<p>She laid the letter from her prospective employers
on his desk, in almost na&iuml;ve fashion. It was as if
she wanted to show this was no woman&rsquo;s threat but
a bona-fide and businesslike proposition. And if she
blushed from sheer foolish joy at the disappointed
and protesting expression that came into his face it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
was small solace after the struggle she had undergone
before she made herself take this step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going,&rdquo; he began, angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
damned if you do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my own dear,&rdquo; she murmured
within. Outwardly she shook her head briskly and
added, &ldquo;Yes, I am. The hours&ndash;&ndash;the salary&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce take that stuff! How much more
money do you want me to pay you? How few hours
a day will you consent to work? You know so well
it has been you who have done your own slave driving.
Besides, I can&rsquo;t get on without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must; I haven&rsquo;t the right to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve stood up, crumpling the letter in his hand.
&ldquo;You mean because of what I said&ndash;&ndash;that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly; partly because I find myself disapproving
of your transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a safe gamble,&rdquo; he began, vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they? I doubt it. Don&rsquo;t ask me to stay.
I want to remain poised and content. If I cannot be
radiantly happy I can be content, the sort of old-lavender-and-star-dust
peace that used to be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I ever said things, made you feel or do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; As she looked at him the gray eyes
turned wistful purple. &ldquo;But it is what we may say
or do, Mister Penny Wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve looked at the crumpled letter. &ldquo;So you
are going over to staid graybeards who deal in cotton
and woollens, and play commercial nun to the end&ndash;&ndash;is
that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do care?&rdquo; he persisted, brutally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care about fool laws&ndash;&ndash;they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
mighty thin stuff. I love you,&rdquo; he told her with
quiet emphasis.</p>
<p>Mary did not answer but the purple of the eyes
changed back to stormy gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say something? Abuse me, claim
me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the courage even if I have the right,&rdquo;
she said, presently. &ldquo;Besides, the last year I have
been loving an ideal&ndash;&ndash;the Steve O&rsquo;Valley who existed
one time and might still exist if other things
were equal. But in reality you are a prematurely
nerve-shattered, blundering pirate; not my Steve.&rdquo;
She spoke his name softly. &ldquo;The failure of my ideal&ndash;&ndash;and
it&rsquo;s a little hard to live with and work with
such a failure. My hands are tied, yet my eyes see.
Besides, there is Luke to think about and care for
until some other woman does it. I cannot endure
this tangle; neither can I get you out of it. So I
am going away. And I&rsquo;ll keep on loving my ideal
and find the old-lavender-and-star-dust sort of
peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going!&rdquo; he repeated, sharply, taking
her hand. &ldquo;Do you hear? I love you. I have
loved you enough to keep silent about it ever since
that day. Does it mean nothing to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it again&ndash;&ndash;it is so hopeless, part of the
tangle. You haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea how hopeless
it is; you are so involved you cannot judge. My boy,
don&rsquo;t you see that the whole trouble lies in getting
things you have never earned? The sort of joy you
people indulge in and try to hold as your own is a
state of mind and emotion from which no lessons
may be learned&ndash;&ndash;calm, stagnant pools of superlative
surface pleasure. No one learns things worth while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
when he is too happy or too successful. That is
why success is a wiser and more enduring thing when
it comes at middle age. The young man or woman
has not been tried out, has not had to struggle and
discover personal limitations. It&rsquo;s the struggle that
brings the wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when you have a ready-made stock-market
fortune handed to you, and a Gorgeous Girl wife,
and the world comes to fawn upon you&ndash;&ndash;you soon
become intoxicated with a false sense of your own
achievements and values. It does not last&ndash;&ndash;nor
does it pay. Such joy periods are merely recuperative
periods. By and by something comes along
and bumps into you and you are shoved out into the
struggling seas&ndash;&ndash;the learning and conquering game.
It is not a sad state of affairs&ndash;&ndash;but a mighty wise one.
Then how can you, who have never earned, expect
a joy to be yours forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have struggled and earned. You have the
right to love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;but you cannot hide behind my skirts
and claim the same right. I shall give you up.
Why, this is no tragedy&ndash;&ndash;it is the way many commercial
nuns find their lives are cast. Commercial
nuns, like their religious sisters, serve a novitiate&ndash;&ndash;their
vocation being tested out. We who find that
the things of our fancy are husks leave them behind
and go on in our abilities. We are needed women
to-day; we must have recognition and respect. We
possess a certain unwomanly honesty according to
old standards, which makes us say such things as I
have said to you. I love you, the ideal of you; yet
I am hopeless to realize it. I refuse to keep on making
my petty moan for sympathy when all the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
the bigger part of me demands work and contentment&ndash;&ndash;and
things just like Gorgeous Girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there must be a way out. I can&rsquo;t lose you.
Do you know what it will mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I do.&rdquo; The gray eyes were so maternal
that Steve felt comforted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you pushing me out of a stagnant joy pool?&rdquo;
he tried saying lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m heading that way when I stop serving
you before all else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, Mary, quite contrary&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he gave her a
gentle little shake&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;say it all again. Then tell
me if this is a mood and you&rsquo;ll change your mind
and stay. You must stay&ndash;&ndash;or else you don&rsquo;t love
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eternal masculine! That we love to be beaten,
cry loudly, tell our neighbours, but we must prove
our affections by crawling back to have you kiss the
bruises.&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;You cannot believe
that the world recognizes a difference between
women with sentiments and sentimental women!
Why, my boy, do you know that convictions, real
convictions, do make a convict of a man, put a
mental ball and chain on him which he can never
deny? I have told you my convictions&ndash;&ndash;I am convinced
I should be doing wrong to both of us to
stay. I shall go&ndash;&ndash;and love my ideal and spend my
salary in soothing things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of a divorce,&rdquo; he found himself
insisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. But should you get one I would not
marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ever?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Unconsciously they both looked at the photograph
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
of the Gorgeous Girl smiling down on them in serene
and frivolous fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ever,&rdquo; she told him, turning away.</p>
<p>There was a directors&rsquo; meeting, which Steve was
obliged to attend. He knew he sat about a table
smoking innumerable cigars without a coherent idea
in his head as to what was being said or considered.
When he rushed back to the office Mary had gone
home and left a note tucked in his blotter. He did
not know that Beatrice had dropped in and discovered
it, reading it with great satisfaction and carefully
replacing it so as to have the appearance of
never having been disturbed. All it said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go to the Meldrum Brothers on the
fifteenth.&ndash;&ndash;M. F.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore the note up in a despairing kind of rage
and wrote Mary as impetuous a love letter as the
Gorgeous Girl had ever received. Five minutes
after writing it he tore that up, too. Then he called
himself several kinds of a fool and dashed out to order
an armful of flowers sent to her apartment. He
had his supper in a grill room, to give him a necessary
interlude before he went home. He walked round
and round a city square watching the queer, shuffling
old men with their trays of needles and pins, wrinkled-faced
women with fortune-telling parrots, and silly
young things prancing up and down, bent on mischief.
Something about human beings bored him; he regretted
exceedingly that he was one himself; and at
the same tune he wished he might countermand the
florist&rsquo;s order. He took a taxi home and wondered
what apology he should make for being late. He had
forgotten that there was a dinner party!</p>
<p>In silver gauze with an impressive square train
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Beatrice greeted him, to say he might as well remain
invisible the rest of the evening, it would look too
absurd to have him appear an hour late with some
clumsy excuse&ndash;&ndash;and as there was an interesting
Englishman who made an acceptable partner for
her everything was taken care of. Papa, minus the
professional reader, was lonesome. He had discovered
an intricate complaint of his circulation and
would welcome an audience.</p>
<p>With relief Steve stole away to Constantine&rsquo;s room
and amid medicine bottles and boxes, air cushions,
hot-water bags, and detective stories, he listened with
half an ear to the reasons why his blood count must
be taken again and what horse thieves the best of
doctors were anyhow!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>The fifteenth of December Mary Faithful left
the office of the O&rsquo;Valley Leather Company,
carrying the thing off as successfully as
Beatrice O&rsquo;Valley carried off her wildest flirtation.
As Mary had often said: &ldquo;When you can fool the
letter man and the charwoman you have nothing to
fear from the secret service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And no employee of the office suspected that anything
lay beneath the surface reasons given for
changing firms. She accepted the handsome farewell
gift with as much apparent pleasure as if she
were to be married and it were a start toward her
silver chest. Mary, too, had learned how to pretend.
Nor did she permit Steve to come snarling&ndash;&ndash;masculine
fashion of sobbing&ndash;&ndash;at her in vain protests
trying to shake her from her resolve.</p>
<p>During the last days of rushed work to help her
successor find the way comparatively easy Mary
kept Steve at arm&rsquo;s length. The same strange joy
at having told him her secret and released the tension
was being relived again in knowing that she was
to leave the tangle with the Gorgeous Girl in command
of it, and go live her commercial nun&rsquo;s existence
in the offices of unromantic old graybeards who
merely thought of her as a mighty clever woman who
would not demand an assistant.</p>
<p>Mary felt that she had truly passed her commercial
novitiate; she made herself admit that a commercial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
life was hers for all time. She would leave a forbidden
world of romance, watching Luke become a
six-footer and an embryo inventor as her special
pride and pleasure. It was good to have it settled,
to have it a scar, pale and calm, throbbing only under
extreme pressure. She even welcomed Beatrice&rsquo;s
hurried visit to the office and met with gentle patience
her half-veiled reproaches for leaving her husband&rsquo;s
employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why you go,&rdquo; Beatrice protested, undecided
whether it was because Steve and Mary had
come to some understanding, as Trudy hinted, and it
would be wiser for Mary to be removed from the
everyday scene of action; or whether Mary had never
thought of Steve except as a man who would not pay
her such and such a salary and therefore, being
tailor-made of heart as well as dress, she coolly
picked up her pad and pencil and was walking off the
lot. With the complacent conceit of all Gorgeous
Girls who fancy that clothes can always conquer,
Beatrice really inclined toward the latter theory. But
being a woman she could not resist having a few
pangs of unrest and trying out her fancied detective
ability upon Mary.</p>
<p>She brought her a farewell gift also&ndash;&ndash;a veil case
which had been given to Beatrice two summers ago. A
fresh ribbon had made it quite all right, so she acted
the Lady Bountiful as she presented her offering and
listened carefully to Mary&rsquo;s sensible reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go running off to Bermuda and Florida
like you people can. I am forced to find my recreation
in my work&ndash;&ndash;and hides and razors are a queer
combination for a woman who really likes gardens
and sea bathing.&rdquo; She laughed so genuinely that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
Beatrice told herself that Trudy was an unpardonable
little fool. &ldquo;I have stayed at the post for some time,
and now that I&rsquo;ve the chance to change my recreation
to fabrics&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m tempted to try it. I&rsquo;m sure you do
understand&ndash;&ndash;and it is with great regret that I leave
the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will make it hard for Mr. O&rsquo;Valley,&rdquo; Beatrice
continued, blandly. &ldquo;Of course I have realized
what an unusual man my husband is&ndash;&ndash;his phenomenal
rise and all that; and papa has always said he
never met any one who was so keen as Steve. I have
always tried to be diplomatic in whatever I said to
Mr. O&rsquo;Valley about his business; I never encourage
his discussing it at home since it is not fair to ask him
to drag it into his playtime. So I can&rsquo;t talk over
actual details with you. But I know it will be hard
for him and he will have quite a time getting readjusted.
He says this Miss Coulson is a nice girl but
temperamentally a Jersey cow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice smiled at this; she had viewed Miss
Coulson immediately upon the news concerning
Mary&rsquo;s resignation, and had felt more than satisfied.
Even Beatrice realized that Miss Coulson was a nice
pink-and-white thing who undoubtedly had a cedar
chest half filled with hope treasures and would at the
first opportunity exchange her desk for a kitchen
cabinet and be happy ever after.</p>
<p>When Beatrice tried discussing the matter with
Steve he responded so listlessly and seemed so apathetic
about either Miss Coulson or Mary that
Beatrice became vastly interested in fall projects of
her own, telling Aunt Belle that her theory was
correct: It was easier to be disappointed in one&rsquo;s
husband than in one&rsquo;s friends, and that Steve was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
the sort who was never going to be concerned about
his wife&rsquo;s disappointment; in fact, he would never
realize it had occurred.</p>
<p>The night Mary left the office for good and all,
leaving clean and empty desk room for Miss Coulson
and the little tea appointments as a token of good
will, Luke met her at the corner and they walked
home together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sorry?&rdquo; Luke asked, curiously. He had
been too busy in technical high school to be office boy
for some time past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only you grow accustomed to things. You
remember how mother felt about the old house.&rdquo;
Somehow the thing was harder to discuss with Luke
as a questioner than with any one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ll miss you a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s place can be filled, we must never
forget that. And I think the change is wise. The
new firm seems agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. O&rsquo;Valley give you anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary flushed. It had been Luke who received the
armful of flowers sent anonymously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The firm gave me the wonderful desk set; you
saw it before it was sent to be monogrammed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I mean Mr. O&rsquo;Valley himself.&rdquo; Luke
was quite manly and threatening as he strode along.
&ldquo;Something for a keepsake because you&rsquo;ve worked
so hard for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paused at a corner to wait for the traffic to
abate. Mary felt faint and queer, as if she had lost
her good right hand and was trying to tell herself it
wasn&rsquo;t such a bad thing after all because she would
only have to buy one glove from now on. Never to
go into Steve&rsquo;s office, never to talk with him, listen to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
him, advise and influence him! She wanted to
forget the sudden burst of affection, the protests of
love, for she could not believe them true. What she
wanted was to return to the old days of guarded
control.</p>
<p>Beatrice&rsquo;s cab whirled by just then and Mary
caught a glimpse of the Gorgeous Girl in a gray cloak
with a wonderful jewelled collar, and Steve beside her.
As the cab passed and Mary and Luke struck out
across the street Mary experienced a sense of defeat.
As she talked to Luke of this and that to turn his
mind from the too-fascinating question of who sent
the flowers, she began to wonder if she, too, would not
wish to be a Gorgeous Girl should the opportunity
present itself? What would her brave platitudes
count if she could wear bright gold tulle with slim
shoulder straps of jet supporting it? Away with
sport attire and untrimmed hats! To have absurdly
frivolous little shoes of blue brocade; to wear the
brown hair in puffs and curls and adorned with jade
and pearls; to have a lace scarf thrown over her
shoulders and a greatcoat of white fur covering the
tulle frock; to go riding, riding, riding, at dusk
through the crowded streets filled with envying shop-girls
and clerks, hard-working men and women. To
ride in an elegant little car with fresh flowers in a gold-banded
vase, a tiny clock saying it was nearly half
after six, outside a gray fog and a rain creeping up to
make the crowds jostle wearily that they might reach
shelter before the storm broke. To have Steve,
handsome and adoring, beside her, laughing at her
indulgently, excusing her frivolous little self, adoring
the fragile, foolish soul of her. At least it would be
worth while trying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can get a construction set for six dollars,&rdquo;
Luke was saying. &ldquo;That will make the bridge
models I told you about last week. I&rsquo;m going to
get one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I would,&rdquo; she punctuated the conversation
recklessly, and then another crowd swept
about them and more elegant little cabs with more
Gorgeous Girls and their cavaliers whirled by. Mary
hated her stupid sophistry about commercial nuns,
novitiates and all, her plain gray-eyed spinster self
doomed to a Persian cat and a bonus at sixty.
Empty, colourless&ndash;&ndash;damnable!</p>
<p>She realized that she had merely given herself an
an&aelig;sthetic, just as Steve had done, one of unreality
and indifference, and that no one stays dormant under
its power for all time. That all so-called commercial
nuns try hard to convince themselves that
watching the procession pass by is quite the best way
of all. Yet there is scant truth or satisfaction in the
statement. At some time or other the hunger for
being loved crashes through the spinster&rsquo;s brave little
platform, the hunger for becoming necessary to someone
in other ways than writing letters or adding
figures&ndash;&ndash;to be home, beside the hearth, keeping the
fires burning, with woes and cares and monotonous
incidents of such a narrowed horizon. It was for
this we were created, Mary Faithful told herself&ndash;&ndash;to
be the dreamers and the ballast and the inspiration
of the race. And if commercial nuns have managed
to tell themselves otherwise&ndash;&ndash;well, who shall be brutal
enough to cry &ldquo;I spy&rdquo; on their little secret? She
understood now the abnormal restlessness that she
had seen in others of her friends&ndash;&ndash;the marriages with
men beneath them in class who earned but half what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
they did; unwise flirtations, even the sordid things
that occasionally creep into the horizon. And she
blamed none of them for any of it.</p>
<p>She knew now that should the chance come she
would want to be a Gorgeous Girl. Gorgeous Girls
have the faculty of being loved, even if they do not
merit the emotion. Tailor-made nuns only love, and
finally set their consciences to work to convince
themselves that a new firm and more severe collars
will be the best way to forget.</p>
<p>Luke was still talking about the construction set
and the new invention and patent rights and heavy
wool sweater with a bean cap for the summer vacation.
Mary was saying: &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;How interesting!&rdquo; at intervals; and so they reached
home, where Mary could plead a headache and go to
her room to battle it out alone.</p>
<p>She felt, too, that the town crier could truthfully
announce that milady was returning to tea gowns for
an indefinite period. And she felt a passionate
hunger to be one of them. That women were going
to rejoice, the majority of them, to take off their lady-major
uniforms, stop driving tractors and wearing
overalls, and with the precious knowledge of the
experience they would evolve quite a new-old standard,
as charming as lavender and lace and as old as
Time&ndash;&ndash;the gentlewoman! They would no longer
accentuate their ugliness with that unlovely honesty
of the feminist which has been quite as distressing as
the impossible Victorian lack of honesty and everlasting
concealment of vital things. They would no
longer be feminists or ladies, but gentlewomen who
sew their own seam, who neither struggle unseen nor
flaunt their emotions in the face of sex psychologists.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>And that both commercial nuns and Gorgeous Girls
must be on the wane. Yet it was too late for Mary
Faithful.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For many reasons Steve stayed away from Mary.
At intervals he sent her flowers without a card, such a
schoolboyish trick to do and yet so harmless that
Mary sent him no word of thanks or blame. She
merely dreamed her gentlewoman&rsquo;s dreams and did
her work in the new office with the same systematic
ability as she had employed for Steve&rsquo;s benefit,
causing the new firm to beam with delight. She had
an even more imposing office than formerly, spread
generously with fur rugs, traps for the weak ankles of
innocent callers. She was treated with great respect.
One time Steve came to see about some civic banquet
in which the head of Mary&rsquo;s new firm was concerned,
and Mary made herself close her door and begin
dictating so as to appear to be occupied. The next
day he slipped a love letter into the bouquet of old-fashioned
flowers he selected for her benefit, and
Mary forced herself to write a card and forbid his
continuing the attentions.</p>
<p>In March Gaylord Vondeplosshe telephoned Mary,
about nine o&rsquo;clock one evening, that Trudy was quite
ill and wanted to see her. Would Mary mind coming
over if he called in the roadster? There was a fearsome
tone in his voice which made Mary consent
despite Luke&rsquo;s protests.</p>
<p>Gay was even more pale and weaker eyed than
ever when he came into the apartment, his motor
coat seeming to hang on his knock-kneed, narrow-chested
self.</p>
<p>It seemed Trudy had not been really well for some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
time. She was such an ambitious little girl, he
explained, excusing himself in the matter at the outset.
He had begged her to rest, to go away, even
commanding it, but she was so ambitious, and there
was so much work on hand that she stayed. It all
began with a cold. Those low-cut waists and pumps
in zero weather. She would not take care of herself
and she dragged round, and refused medicine, and he,
Gay, had done everything possible under the circumstances;
he wanted Mary to be quite clear as to this
point.</p>
<p>They finally reached the apartment house, where
Gay clambered out and offered Mary his left little
finger as a means of support on the icy walk. When
she came into the front bedroom of the apartment&ndash;&ndash;a
shabby room when one looked at it closely&ndash;&ndash;and
looked at Trudy she saw death written in the thin
white face bereft of rouge, the red curls lying in limp
confusion on the silly little head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary,&rdquo; Trudy began, coughing and trying to
sit up, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never come. Why, I&rsquo;m not
so sick&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Gay, go outside and wait for the doctor
and the nurse. Just think, I&rsquo;m going to afford a
nurse. Oh, the pain in the chest is something fierce.&rdquo;
She had lapsed into her old-time vernacular.
&ldquo;Every bone of me aches and my heart thumps as if
it was awful mad at me. I guess it ought to be,
Mary. How good it is to have you. Take off your
things. Gee, that pain is some pain! Um&ndash;&ndash;I
wonder if the doctor can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to stay all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was doing some trifle to make her more
comfortable. Trudy seemed too weak to answer but
she smiled like a delighted child. She pointed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
finger, the one wearing the diamond ring, to a chair
beside the bed. Mary drew it up closer and sat
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear, you must put on a warm dressing
gown and something to pad your chest&ndash;&ndash;this
nightgown is a farce,&rdquo; she said, sternly, rising.
&ldquo;Where shall I find something? Oh, Trudy&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy had halfway lifted herself in bed with
sudden pain, moaning and laughing in terrible
fashion. Mary caught her in her arms. Trudy lay
back, quite contented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;ve been a bluff,&rdquo; she said, tears on the
white, shiny cheeks. &ldquo;Gee, but that doctor takes his
time, too. I had to beg something great before husband
would go for you. He&rsquo;s awful mean, but I
always told you he was, and he would have a fine
time if I should die, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; More terrible
little laughs as Trudy still nestled in the warm curve
of Mary&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Mary said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an
order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay tiptoed in to say that the doctor had returned
but no nurse was available. They might get one in
a few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; Mary offered.</p>
<p>Trudy smiled again. &ldquo;Rather&ndash;&ndash;have&ndash;&ndash;Mary,&rdquo;
she managed to gasp.</p>
<p>The doctor was a preoccupied man who did not
fancy late calls on foolish little creatures wearing
silk nightgowns when they were nearing death. He
gave some drastic orders and Gay was dispatched
with a list of articles to be bought while Mary
hunted high and low in the disorderly apartment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
finally wrapping Trudy in thick draperies, the only
sensible things she could discover.</p>
<p>Trudy lay very still for a few minutes. Mary
thought she was dozing until she said in an animated
voice: &ldquo;Did you see the ring? It&rsquo;s a wonderful
stone.&rdquo; Wilfully she thrust her skeleton-like fingers
out from the bed covers.</p>
<p>Mary nodded. But Trudy was not to be discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but that ring made a lot of trouble. Mary,
come here, deary. Will you forgive me? They say
you forgive the dead anything. Listen, I was awfully
discouraged and Gay was so mean and I was all
wrong, anyway&ndash;&ndash;you know&ndash;&ndash;foolish&ndash;&ndash;see? Beatrice
was mean, too.... I want you to marry Steve
because he loves you, and a divorce won&rsquo;t break her
heart&ndash;&ndash;you just see if it does. I always knew he was
the one you liked&ndash;&ndash;and he does care now. Sure, he
does. You can tell. Even I can tell, Mary....
I just told her so&ndash;&ndash;and my, she is wild but won&rsquo;t admit
it. She never asked me to her house after that
if she could get out of it. And now I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;and I
want you to have the ring. That will help some,
won&rsquo;t it? You tell Gay what I said. You must have
it. Your fingers are thin and long and can carry it
off well. And so you do forgive me, don&rsquo;t you? I
shouldn&rsquo;t have told her, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, she was
so mean. And now he cares&ndash;&ndash;and you can be
happy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told Mrs. O&rsquo;Valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trudy was panting. Perspiration stood on the
white forehead as she managed to finish: &ldquo;I said you
always loved her husband and now he loves you&ndash;&ndash;and
I am sorry. But I was mad at them all; you can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
understand because you&rsquo;re not my sort....
But you can be happy now. Marry him and make
him happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dozed into a contented sleep. A little later it
was all over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>Gay&rsquo;s course of action was exactly what his
wife had prophesied. He displayed all the
proper symptoms of mourning and grief as
far as his clothing and stationery went. After a
brief period of retirement from the world, during
which he chattered with fear when he wrapped
Trudy&rsquo;s gay little possessions in bundles and gave
them away, he emerged in the satisfactory role of a
young widower on the loose who feels that &ldquo;Perhaps
it was all for the best; an idyl of youth, y&rsquo;know;
someone quite out of my sphere,&rdquo; and was welcomed
by the old set enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Beatrice particularly saw to it that he was petted
and properly cared for regarding invitations and
dainties to eat and drink. In this new r&ocirc;le, with a
well-established business and no shrewd red-haired
wife to point out his meannesses and try to make
him go fifty-fifty with the profits, Gay felt at peace
with all the world.</p>
<p>He did not even miss Trudy&rsquo;s work after a little.
The only thing that bothered him was an occasional
memory of the white, thin face and those limp, red
curls, the hacking cough and the way her big eyes
had stared at him that last night. He hated anything
connected with suffering of any kind, let alone
death itself.</p>
<p>Before long Gay found himself back at the club
and running a neat shop on a prominent corner with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
deaf mutes from charity institutions ensconced in the
back rooms to do the work. Memories of Trudy and
of their life together became as remote as the menu
of a dinner eaten twelve months past.</p>
<p>He had her ring set over for himself, Mary never
having mentioned the matter. In fact, he avoided
Mary as he avoided Steve, for it was Mary who had
spent the last moments with Trudy, and whatever
was said remained a most uncomfortable mystery, to
Gay&rsquo;s way of thinking. She had remained at the
apartment to help Gay through his sorrow, looking at
him with brief scorn as he stammered inane thanks,
scantily concealing his impatience to sample a basket
of wine just sent in.</p>
<p>As Easter Sunday came slipping into the calendar,
with Mary and Luke sightseeing in New York in
plebeian fashion and not ashamed of it, there came a
great though not unexpected crash in Steve O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s
fortunes. Steve&rsquo;s unreckoned-with enemies
were about to have their innings; they succeeded in
bringing Steve down to the level of being forced to
ask his father-in-law for aid and admit that he could
not handle Constantine&rsquo;s affairs or what remained of
them.</p>
<p>This was exactly what the enemies desired. A
number of things combined to make the crash a
mighty one. Steve still speculated, secure, he
fancied, in his surplus savings; his speculations all
ended disastrously and his factories were no longer
hustling places of commerce. It was a case of keen
competition for orders, and closing round Steve
relentlessly was a circle of enemies forming a gigantic
trust which played the big-fish-swallow-the-little-fish
game. Knowing of Steve&rsquo;s disaster on the stock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
exchange, as well as the thin ice on which his industries
were managing to survive, the trust now invited
him to become one of them&ndash;&ndash;at a ridiculous figure&ndash;&ndash;or
else be squeezed out of the game overnight.</p>
<p>Steve&rsquo;s first emotion upon receiving the offer was
nonchalance and determination to appear unconcerned
and weather it through&ndash;&ndash;so he held out as
long as he could, plunging in the stock market, with
the result that he was beaten as if he had been a street
vendor whose wares were confiscated by the police
authorities.</p>
<p>It was not a time to do some new devil-may-care
thing. Fortunes were not achieved as they had
been from 1914 to 1919, and Steve told himself in
vain that since it was luck that had made him it must
be luck that should again bring him out on top of the
heap. All at once luck seemed no jaunty chap with
endless pockets of gold but rather a disgruntled,
threadbare old chap who said: &ldquo;None of you ever
treats me rightly when I do smile on you; now go take
care of yourselves any way you like, for you have
ruined me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this pleasant state of affairs Steve came
home to the Villa Rosa one April day, half of him
wondering if Mary would let him come and tell
his story and the other half trying to hope that the
news of his failure would prove the saving grace
between the Gorgeous Girl and himself, that she
would accept his plea of becoming &ldquo;just folks&rdquo; and
starting anew, her father&rsquo;s wealth in the background,
entirely removed from Steve&rsquo;s new field of endeavours.</p>

&ldquo;<i>A get-rich-quick man always pays for his own speed</i>&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It did not take long to disillusion Steve as to this.
Beatrice accepted the news of the stock failure and
the new trust so easily that he saw she was incapable
of changing her viewpoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why gamble so, my dear Stevuns?&rdquo; she began,
almost petulantly. &ldquo;And do you know that every
time I make engagements for you you are late? You
are nearly a half hour late to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am losing the factory as well. I&rsquo;ll have to sell
out for a song. I can&rsquo;t compete with cutthroats&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to hurry and dress so we can go?&rdquo;
She smiled her prettiest.</p>
<p>At one time Steve would have noted only that
white tulle and pearls spun witchery, and her skirt
possessed the charm of a Hawaiian girl&rsquo;s dancing
costume. Even at this juncture he recalled and
smiled at past blindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand what I am saying,
and all that is happening. First I played Arizona copper
until they taught me not to monkey with the band
wagon; then I played Cobalt until the same thing
took place.&rdquo; He sank impolitely into an easy-chair.
&ldquo;Then I got the chance to come in with the gang&ndash;&ndash;an
insulting proposition any way you want to figure&ndash;&ndash;a
paltry sum for everything I have and the statement
in veiled terms that I need not expect to have that
unless I did as they dictate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;sell your business to someone else before
this happens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even if I wished to cheat; it is quite the
talk of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;manage. Papa will tell you how. Why
do you come running to me? Goodness, don&rsquo;t stare
like that. It&rsquo;s nothing unusual to manage! I don&rsquo;t
know about business&ndash;&ndash;you made a lot of money once
and I should think you could do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t bother me as much as you think,&rdquo; he
said, almost breathlessly, eager to know the worst.
&ldquo;It means I am a poor man in your estimation. I
can sell out to these people, who have thrown a steel
ring round their game, so to speak, and had to do it
until your father was out of the running. I can never
buck them&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not fool enough to be goaded on to
try. Your father could not win out the way things
are now&ndash;&ndash;but he could have prevented their ever
getting the upper hand&ndash;&ndash;because he knows every
last turn of the wheel. They could not have fooled
him. I didn&rsquo;t know what was coming until it was
too late. A get-rich-quick man always pays for his
own speed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stevuns, you&rsquo;ll make me so nervous I can&rsquo;t go to-night.
It&rsquo;s a lovely party. You stay home and tell
papa all about it, but leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will. And is this the sympathy
and the understanding you give me when I say we are
being ruined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep saying it.&rdquo; She stamped her little
foot. &ldquo;Papa has lots of money in English and
Chinese securities and I don&rsquo;t know what-all. Why,
that factory of his was the least of his fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why your father deliberately lifted three
fourths of his money from the business just before he
was taken ill. He was not going to risk cutthroats
getting together. He overestimated my ability to
keep clear of disaster. But after all, I&rsquo;m not sorry&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t want anything more than I have earned. For
you always pay for it in some way. The world may
not know but these snap-judgment profiteers, these
get-rich-quick phenomena, always have to pay. But
you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he added, gently, &ldquo;do you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
You must not be blamed for not understanding anything
unless it comprises a good time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not try,&rdquo; she said, petulantly, &ldquo;and if you
love me you will hurry to change your things and tell
papa briefly. To-morrow will be time enough to go
into detail and have him start you into something
new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take your father&rsquo;s money to marry you
with, and even if I stole it in a sense it was my own
efforts that brought it to pass. I took no help from
him until I was established. And I shall not sneak
back to let my wife&rsquo;s father support me now. I&rsquo;m
going to drop out of this game, Beatrice. It is for
you to decide whether you go with me or stay at the
Villa Rosa.&rdquo; He stood up suddenly and came close
to her, looking down at her, in all her fragile loveliness,
wondering, half hoping, halfway expecting
that a miracle might happen even as he had hoped
for the miracle of his fortune&ndash;&ndash;that at this late hour
she might cease to be a mere Gorgeous Girl and understand.</p>
<p>Beatrice frowned, playing with her fan. &ldquo;You
look shabby and tired,&rdquo; she complained; &ldquo;not my
handsome Steve. You don&rsquo;t mean such things,
because you do love me and you know I could never
be happy living any other way. I&rsquo;m all papa has
and he wants me to have everything I want. Of
course I want this dear house and you and all that
both of you mean, so be a lamb and get dressed and
papa will help you into some nice safe business that
can never fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood on her tiptoes, about to kiss him. But
he pushed her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you won&rsquo;t begin with me, you won&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
take our one chance for happiness? Just to begin
together to learn and earn, be real? Do you think
for one instant I will be like Gay Vondeplosshe,
subsisting on a woman&rsquo;s bounty? No. I shall
support my wife; it was never my wish that we come
here to live, and you insisted upon luxuries my purse
could not afford. In the main, to the outsider, I
have supported you. But we both know it is not
true; I have merely been a needful accessory. From
now on I shall either support you or else not live with
you. I ask you to stop having a good time long
enough to give me your decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Stevuns&ndash;&ndash;you funny old brutish dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were a direct loan of money from your father
it would be a different matter&ndash;&ndash;but it is one of those
intricate, involved deals that mean more than you or
I choose to admit. It means that I have learned the
hollow satisfaction in being a rich man and husband
of a Gorgeous Girl. I want to be a plain American
with a wife who is content with something else save
a Villa Rosa and pound-and-a-half lap dogs. I am
going to be a mediocre failure in the eyes of your set,
since it is the only way in which I can start to be a
true success in other than dollar standards. The
two elements that collect a crowd and breed newspaper
headlines are mystery and struggle; remove
them and you find yourself serene and secure. That
is what I propose to do. I ask if it is too late for
you to come with me or are you going to linger in
the Villa Rosa? Answer me&ndash;&ndash;I want something real,
common, definite&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever dare treat me like this again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she began, whimpering.</p>
<p>Steve brushed by her and up the stairs. He went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
into Constantine&rsquo;s room, where the old man lay
in helpless discontent, his dulling eyes looking
at the sunken gardens and the chattering peacocks
and his heart longing for Hannah and the early days
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Steve,&rdquo; he said in a pleased tone, &ldquo;you
look as if they were after you. Thought you&rsquo;d forgotten
me. That nurse Bea engaged has a voice like
a scissors grinder in action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Steve told him what had taken place, not
mentioning Beatrice&rsquo;s name. It had an astonishing
effect; as a mental tonic it was not to be surpassed,
for the fallen oak of a man throbbed anew with life,
as much as was possible, his hands twitching with
rage, his teeth grinding, and the dulled eyes bright
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs! I knew it! Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me
long before? Blocked &rsquo;em off&ndash;&ndash;snuffed &rsquo;em out.
Meddling with wildcat stocks&ndash;&ndash;asinine any way you
figure it! Well, I don&rsquo;t know that I blame you. The
first success was too sweet to leave untried again,
eh?&rdquo; He chuckled as if something amused him.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll close out to &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll start again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want another fortune handed me,&rdquo; Steve
interrupted. &ldquo;I want to earn it, if you please. I&rsquo;m
not a pauper in the true sense of the word; I am
merely trained down to the proper financial weight
for a man of my age and experience to carry, and I
can now enter the ring with good chances. The other
way was as absurd as the four-year-old prodigy who
typewrites and is rather fond of Greek. But I loved
your daughter and I thought it quite the right thing
to do. I asked your daughter just now if she was
willing to live with a poor man, according to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
standards, as your wife lived with you&ndash;&ndash;to give me
her help and her faith in me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what she answered? She told me
to come to you and truckle for another big loan,
which I am not capable of handling, to cheat legally
and never hint to the world the truth of the affair.
She hadn&rsquo;t the most remote idea that I was in earnest
when I told her I was going to be a failure in the
eyes of the world&ndash;&ndash;but I was not going to have my
wife&rsquo;s father support me. I&rsquo;m not sorry this has
happened&ndash;&ndash;feel as if the Old Man of the Sea had
dropped off me. But this is the thing: either my
wife and I will live in a home of our own, and such
a home as I can provide, being an independent and
proper family and keeping our problems and responsibilities
within our gates; or else your daughter is
going to stay with you and lose her one chance of
freedom while I leave town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Basque grandmother and the Celtic grandfather
lent Steve all their passionate determination
and keenness of insight, as they once lent him chivalry,
humour, and charm. He stood before the old
man taut with excitement and flushed with sudden
fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you I blame,&rdquo; he added before Constantine
could make answer. &ldquo;You kept her as useless as a
china shepherdess; it is not her fault if she fails to
rise to the occasion now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s face quivered; what the emotion
was none but himself knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor fool boy!&rdquo; he said, thickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know I made you a rich man all along the line?
You never did anything at all. It wasn&rsquo;t luck on
the stock exchange&ndash;&ndash;it was Mark Constantine back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of you. Gad, to have made what you did in the
time you did you&rsquo;d have had to do worse than dabble
your hands in the mud. You&rsquo;d have had to roll in
it&ndash;&ndash;like I did.&rdquo; He gave a coarse laugh. &ldquo;That
was what I figured out when you said you wanted
Beatrice and what you were going to do to try to get
her. I liked you, I wanted you for her husband. I
hated the other puppies. So I wasn&rsquo;t going to have
Beatrice&rsquo;s husband a cutthroat and a highbinder as he
would have to be if he had turned the whole trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You young fool, don&rsquo;t you suppose I made the
stock exchange yield you the sugarplums? Gad,
I knew every cent you spent and made. It was for
my girl, my Gorgeous Girl, so why wouldn&rsquo;t I do it?
I saved your ideals and kept your hands white so
that you would be good enough for her; that was
what I figured out the hour after you had told me
your intentions. I followed you like the fairy books
tell of; I brought you your fortune and your factory
and scotched all the enemies about you&ndash;&ndash;and gave
you the girl. And you thought you killed the seven-headed
dragon yourself.... I don&rsquo;t blame you
for the foozle, Steve; I cotton-woolled you all along&ndash;&ndash;it
was bound to come. But, damme, you&rsquo;ll come
down to brass tacks and take more of my money
now and keep her from being unhappy and stop this
snivel about earning what you get and needing responsibilities&ndash;&ndash;or
you&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ve put your foot
into hell and you can&rsquo;t pull it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>White-heat anger enveloped Steve&rsquo;s very soul, yet
strangely enough he felt not like sinning but rather
like Laertes crying out in mental anguish: &ldquo;Do you
see this, O God?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>Steve knew he brushed by Aunt Belle, who
was coming in to see what her brother was
roaring about, and down those detestable
gilded curlicue stairs to seek out his wife and try
again to make her realize that for once he was determined
on what should come to pass as regarded
their future together, to force her to realize even if he
created a cheap scene.</p>
<p>Whatever blame fell upon Constantine&rsquo;s shoulders
was not within his province to judge&ndash;&ndash;Constantine
was a dying man and Steve was not quite thirty-five.
So that ended the matter from Steve&rsquo;s viewpoint.
It was his intention not to try to evade his personal
blame in the matter but to make reparation to his
own self and to his wife if he were permitted. If he
could once convince his wife that their sole chance
of future happiness and sanity lay in beginning as
medium-incomed young persons with all the sane
world before them it would have been worth it all&ndash;&ndash;excepting
for Mary Faithful.</p>
<p>Even as Steve tried in a quick, tense fashion to dismiss
Mary from his mind and say that Beatrice was
his wife and that love must come as the leavener once
this hideous wealth was removed, he knew the thing
was impossible. The best solution of which he was
capable was to say that he owed it to both Mary
Faithful and Beatrice to play the game from the right
angle and that in causing Beatrice to disclaim her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
title of Gorgeous Girl and all it implied he at least
would find contentment&ndash;&ndash;the same sort of uninteresting
contentment of which Mary boasted.</p>
<p>He found Beatrice in a furore of tears and protests,
angered at missing the dinner engagement and not
understanding why any of it was necessary. She
felt her own territory had been infringed upon, since
making a scene was her peculiar form of mental intoxication.</p>
<p>But Steve was composed, even smiling, and as he
came up to her she fancied her father had made everything
all right as his check book had seen fit to do
upon so many occasions. The slight worry over
Steve&rsquo;s possible folly vanished, and she felt it safe to
proceed to reproach him for having been so horrid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear Stevuns, why did you get me all
upset? And yourself and poor papa, to say nothing
of my having to send word at the last moment that
we could not attend the dinner. Oh, Steve, Steve,
will you ever be really tamed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and sit beside me.&rdquo; He drew out a notebook
and pencil. &ldquo;I must tell you some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather curious, she obeyed, but keeping a discreet
distance so her frock would not be ruffled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
still cross,&rdquo; she warned.</p>
<p>Steve was writing down figures, adding them and
making notations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, dear,&rdquo; he began, patiently; &ldquo;this is
just where I shall stand&ndash;&ndash;a poor man to your way
of thinking, almost as poor as when I set out to win
you. I&rsquo;m going into a salaried job for a few years&ndash;&ndash;a
real hope-to-die job&ndash;&ndash;and we can have a house&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we talked that all out before,&rdquo; she interrupted,
half petulantly, half wistfully. &ldquo;Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
do you keep repeating yourself? You&rsquo;ll be thumping
your fists the first thing we know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fancy I am not going to do this? Are
you not sufficiently concerned to listen, to realize
that I have been a blind, conceited fool? But I
have learned my lesson. I shall support my wife
from now on and live in my own house or else I
shall no longer be your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened and shut her fan quickly, then it fell
to the floor. But he did not pick it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never keen for details, so I shall not
irritate you now by introducing them. But the
fact remains that I have been made and backed by
your father merely because he wished me to be your
husband. You picked me out&ndash;&ndash;and I was keen to
be picked out&ndash;&ndash;and he decided to make me as proper
a companion for you as possible. I am in some ways
as untried to-day as any youngster starting out; as
I was when I fancied I made the grand and initial
stride by myself. Your father feels that I ought to be
eternally grateful&ndash;&ndash;but then, what else could the
father of the Gorgeous Girl think? He has harmed
me&ndash;&ndash;but he has ruined you. I hardly thought you
would meet me halfway, still it was worth the try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetful of her flounces Beatrice crumpled them
in her hands, saying sharply: &ldquo;Are you taking this
way of getting out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Steve murmured, half inaudibly,
&ldquo;I keep forgetting you have never been taught values
or sincerity! There is no way I can prove to you
how in earnest I am, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that I am a failure?&rdquo; she
preened herself unconsciously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The most gorgeous failure we have with us to-day!
And the worst of it is it is growing to be a
common type of failure since gorgeousness is becoming
prevalent. There are many like you&ndash;&ndash;not many
more gorgeous, and thousands less so. You are
a type that has developed in the last twenty years
and is developing these days at breakneck speed!
And you can&rsquo;t understand and you don&rsquo;t want to and
I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll try to explain again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she asked, shrewdly, quite the woman
of the world, &ldquo;what is it you are about to do? Wear
corduroy trousers and a red bandanna and start a
butcher-paper-covered East-Side magazine filled
with ravings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that is another type we plain Americans
have on our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spar for time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m through sparring; I want to go to
work. I want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was the use? He stopped before adding
another spark to her wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you want to marry that woman&ndash;&ndash;Mary
Faithful, who has loved you so long and made
herself so useful! She was clever enough to pretend
to efface herself and go to work for someone else,
but I dare say you have seen her as often as before.
Oh, are you surprised I know? I gave you the credit
of being above such a thing, but Trudy told me that
this woman had told her the truth&ndash;&ndash;so you see even
your Mary Faithful cannot be trusted. You had better
turn monk, Steve, be done with the whole annoying
pack of us! Anyway, Trudy came running to me,
but I never lost sleep over the rumour. I felt you
were above such things, as I said, but presently little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
indications&ndash;&ndash;straws, you know&ndash;&ndash;told me she cared;
and if a woman cares for a man and is able to pass
several hours each day in his employ, unless she is
cross-eyed or a blithering idiot she cannot fail to win
the game! Now can she, Stevuns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve raised his hand in protest. &ldquo;Please leave
her out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&ndash;&ndash;we must talk about my being a failure, my
father clipping your wings of industry and all that&ndash;&ndash;yet
we must not mention a woman who has loved
you&ndash;&ndash;and gossiped about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not! You know Trudy&ndash;&ndash;you know her
nature,&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking up her defence! Noble Stevuns! Then
you do reciprocate&ndash;&ndash;and you are planning one of
those ready-to-be-served bungalows with even a
broom closet and lovely glass doorknobs, where Mary
may gambol about in organdie and boast of the prize
pie she has baked for your supper. Oh, Stevuns,
you are too funny for words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, but there was a malicious sparkle
in her eyes. She was carrying off the situation as
best she knew how, for she did not comprehend its
true significance, its highest motive. Underneath
her veneer of sarcasm and ridicule she was hurt,
stabbed&ndash;&ndash;quite helpless.</p>
<p>With her father&rsquo;s spirit she resolved to take the
death gamely&ndash;&ndash;and make Steve as ridiculous as possible,
to have as good a time as she could out of such
a sorry ending. But she knew as she stood facing
him, so tired and heavy-eyed, the rejected sheet of
figures fallen on the brocaded sofa between them,
that it was she who met and experienced lasting defeat.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>By turns she had been the spoiled child of fortune,
the romantic parasite, the mad butterfly, the advanced
woman, the Bolshevik de luxe; and finally
and for all time to come she was confronted with the
last possibility&ndash;&ndash;there was no forked road for her&ndash;&ndash;that
of a shrewd, cold flirt. She realized too late the
injustice done her under the name of a father&rsquo;s loving
protection. Moreover, she determined never to let
herself realize to any great extent the awfulness of
the injustice. It was, as Steve said, a common fate
these days&ndash;&ndash;there was solace in the fact of never
being alone in her defeat. But at five minutes after
twelve she had glimpsed the situation and regretted
briefly all she was denied. Still it was an impossibility
to cease being a Gorgeous Girl.</p>
<p>She felt cheated, stunted, revengeful because of
this common fate. Steve was setting out for new
worlds to conquer&ndash;&ndash;he very likely would have a good
time in so doing. She must continue to be fearfully
rushed and terribly popular, having a good time,
too. How dull everything was! Strangely, she
did not give Mary Faithful or her part in Steve&rsquo;s
future a thought&ndash;&ndash;just then. She was thinking that
Ibsen merely showed the awakened Nora&rsquo;s going out
the door&ndash;&ndash;as have Victorian matrons shown their
daughters, urging them to do likewise. But it
really begins to be interesting at this very point
since it is not the dramatic closing of the door that
is so vital, but the pitfalls and adventures on the long
road that Nora and her sisters have seen fit to travel.</p>
<p>Beatrice was deprived of even this chance, even
the falling by the wayside and admitting a new sort
of defeat, or travelling the road in cold, supreme
fashion and ending with selfish victory and impersonal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
theories warranted to upset the most domestic and
content of her stay-at-home sisters. But she, like
all Gorgeous Girls, must be content to stand peering
through the luxurious gates of her father&rsquo;s house,
watching Steve go down the long road, then glancing
back at her lovely habitation, where no one except
tradesmen really took her seriously, and where all
that was expected of her, or really permitted, was
to have a good time.</p>
<p>Steve shrugged his shoulders. He felt a great
weariness concerning the situation, nonchalant scorn
of what happened in the future of this woman. As
for Mary Faithful&ndash;&ndash;that was a different matter, but
he could not think about Mary Faithful while standing
in the salon of the Villa Rosa with the Gorgeous
Girl as mentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do not try to talk any more just
now?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;We are neither one fit to do
so. Wait until morning and then come to an agreement.&rdquo;
He spoke as impersonally as if a stranger
asking aid interrupted his busiest time.</p>
<p>Beatrice recognized the tone and what it implied.
&ldquo;I am agreed,&rdquo; she said, after a second&rsquo;s hesitation.
&ldquo;Do not fancy my father and I will come on our
knees to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swept from the room in a dignified manner.
Steve waited until he heard the door of Constantine&rsquo;s
room bang. He knew his wife had rushed to tell her
father her side of the matter&ndash;&ndash;to receive the eternal
heart&rsquo;s ease in the form of a check so she could go
and play and forget all about Stevuns the brute.</p>
<p>He walked unsteadily through the rooms of the lower
floor, out on to the main balcony, and back again.
He could not think in these rooms; he could not think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
in any corner of the whole tinsel house. It seemed
a consolation prize to those who have been forbidden
to think.</p>
<p>He went to his own ornate and impossible room,
which should have belonged to an actor desiring
publicity, or some such puppet as Gay. He tried
to sleep, but that too was impossible. He kept pacing
back and forth and back and forth, playing the
white bear as Beatrice had so often said, wondering
if it would be too much the act of a cad to go to Mary
Faithful and merely tell her. He could think at
Mary&rsquo;s house&ndash;&ndash;he must have a chance to think, to
realize that Beatrice refused to come with him and to
tell himself that nothing should force him to remain
in the Villa Rosa and be the husband of the Gorgeous
Girl, set right by her father&rsquo;s checks, the laughingstock
of the business world that had called his hand.</p>
<p>The humiliation, the failure, the loss&ndash;&ndash;were good
to have; stimulating.</p>
<p>Wonderfully alive and keen, he did not know how
to express the new sensation that took possession
of his jaded brain. He was like a gourmand dyspeptic
who has long hesitated before trying the diet of a
workingman and when someone has whisked him
off to a sanitarium and fed him bran and milk until
he has forgotten nerves, headaches, and logginess he
vows eternal thankfulness to bran and milk, and is
humbly setting out to adopt the workingman&rsquo;s diet
instead of the old-time menus.</p>
<p>Steve could begin to work simply, to find his permanent
place in the commercial world. He had
enough money&ndash;&ndash;or would have&ndash;&ndash;to start a home in
simple yet pleasant fashion; he had knowledge and
ability that would place him favourably and furnish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
him the chance to work normally toward the top.
That was all very well, he told himself toward early
morning&ndash;&ndash;but must it be done alone? He had had
the Gorgeous Girl as the incentive to make his fortune,
and now he had Mary Faithful as the incentive
to lose it&ndash;&ndash;and if the Gorgeous Girl stayed on at the
villa and became that pitied, dangerous object, a
divorcee; and if Mary did care&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;-Strange things,
both wonderful and fearsome, happen in the United
States of America.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>Beatrice, never having gone to her father
for anything save money, did not know how
to broach the subject in heartfelt and deep-water
fashion. When she went into his room she
found him with scarlet spots burning in his grayish
cheeks, his dark eyes harsher and more formidable
than ever. He tried twisting himself on the bed,
resulting in awkward, halfway muscular contortions
and gruff moans punctuating the failure. He held
out his arms to her and she went flying into them,
not the dignified woman of the world putting a cave
man in his proper place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is impossible!&rdquo; was all she said, giving way to
hysterical sobs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t even try talking to him
again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>More gruff moans before Constantine began coherently:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do what I say or he&rsquo;ll not stay in this
house. I expected this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand, papa. He doesn&rsquo;t
want to stay here, not at all! He does not want me.
There, now you know it! He must have said something
of this to you&ndash;&ndash;perhaps you didn&rsquo;t believe him.
Neither did I&ndash;&ndash;at first. Oh, my head aches terribly
and I know I shall be ill. He wants me to be a poor
man&rsquo;s wife&ndash;&ndash;starting again, he calls it&ndash;&ndash;while he
earns a salary and we live in a poky house and I do
the cooking. I&rsquo;d think it awfully funny if it was
happening to any of my friends&ndash;&ndash;but this is terrible!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
Well, goat-tending tells, doesn&rsquo;t it? And after all
we have done for him&ndash;&ndash;to babble on about honesty
and earning and all those socialistic ideas. He is a
dangerous man, papa; really. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constantine stopped moaning. &ldquo;Look up at me.&rdquo;
He made her lift her face from the tangle of silk
bed quilts. &ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa, I always adored Stevuns&ndash;&ndash;but of
course I can&rsquo;t give up the things to which I&rsquo;ve been
accustomed! It&rsquo;s so silly that I think he is queer
even to suggest it&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t love him if he goes out of here and
you stay,&rdquo; the old man said, slowly; &ldquo;but if he
will stay and do as I tell him&ndash;&ndash;then you&rsquo;ll love
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;with great relief that she was not called
upon to keep on explaining and analyzing her own
feelings and Steve&rsquo;s motives; it was entirely too much
of a strain&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that is it. If Steve will stay here and
do what you tell him&ndash;&ndash;I think he&rsquo;d better retire from
business and just look after our interests&ndash;&ndash;I shall forgive
him. But if he keeps up this low anarchistic
talk about dragging me to a washtub&ndash;&ndash;oh, it&rsquo;s too
absurd!&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to Reno and be done with all of
it.&rdquo; She drew away from her father and the same
cold, shrewd look of the mature flirt replaced her
confusion. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that is sensible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father closed his eyes for a moment. Then
he whispered: &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice had to stoop to catch the words. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t be expected to love people that make you unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you? Did
you never think that loving someone is the bravest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
thing in the world? It takes courage to keep on
loving the dead, for instance; the dead that keep
stabbing away at your heart all through the years.
Loving doesn&rsquo;t always make you happy, it makes you
brave&ndash;&ndash;real love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to look at her closely. Beatrice
whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for your drops? You&rsquo;re too excited,
papa dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t love him,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Well,
then, it&rsquo;s best for you both that he go&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s all
I&rsquo;ve got to say. I thought you cared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted. &ldquo;Really, I can&rsquo;t find
any one who can talk about this thing sensibly,&rdquo; she
began.</p>
<p>Suddenly she thought of Gay. There was always
Gay; at least she could never disappoint him, which
was what she meant by having him talk sensibly.
Gay knew everyone, how to laugh at the most foolish
whims, pick up fans, exercise lap dogs, and wear a
fancy ball costume. What a blessed thing it was
there was Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been quite too strenuous an evening,&rdquo;
she said, in conclusion, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;m off for bed. Steve
and I will talk more to-morrow. Good-night, papa.
I&rsquo;m terribly distressed that this has come up to annoy
you.&rdquo; She bent and kissed him prettily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you make more fuss when your lap
dog had a goitre operation,&rdquo; her father surprised her
by way of an answer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all different in my mind
now.&rdquo; The thick fingers picked at the bed quilt. &ldquo;I
thought it would break your heart, but it&rsquo;s just that
you want to break his spirit; so it&rsquo;s better he should
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>Left alone, Constantine lay staring into darkness,
his harsh eyes winking and blinking, and the gnarled
thick fingers, which had robbed so cleverly by way
of mahogany-trimmed offices and which had written
so many checks for his Gorgeous Girl, kept on
their childish picking at the quilt. Yet his love for
Beatrice, monument to his folly, never dimmed.
He merely was beginning to realize the truth&ndash;&ndash;too
late to change it. And as the pain of loving his dead
wife had never ceased throughout the years, so the
new and more poignant pain of loving his daughter
and knowing that she was in the wrong began tugging
at his heartstrings. Well, he was the original
culprit; he must see her through the game with flying
colours. As for Steve&ndash;&ndash;he envied him!</p>
<p>In the morning Steve was accosted by Aunt Belle,
who felt she must say her conventional, marcelled,
gray-satin, and violet-perfumed reproaches. All
Beatrice had told her was that Steve was now an impossible
pauper, that he loved Mary Faithful and had
loved her for years, that it was quite awful, and she
was going to divorce him. Her aunt, with the proper
emotions of a Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s aunt, and uncomfortable
memories of love in a cottage with the late Mr.
Todd, began to upbraid Steve. She began in a cold,
stereotyped fashion, calling his attention to the
broken-hearted wife, the sick man who lay upstairs
and who had befriended him, and of the social ostracism
that was to result should he take such a
drastic step.</p>
<p>She felt it indelicate to mention Mary but she did
say there were &ldquo;other vicious deceits of which we are
well aware, my young man,&rdquo; warning him that in
years to come old age would bring nothing but remorse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
and terror, asking him what he would be forced
to think when his marriage was recalled?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My marriage?&rdquo; Steve answered, too pleasantly
to be safe. &ldquo;I dare say in time I&rsquo;ll come to realize
it is always the open season for salamanders.&rdquo; Which
left Aunt Belle with the wild thought that she must
accompany Beatrice to Reno to sit out in the sagebrush
for the best part of a year.</p>
<p>Steve found his wife in her dressing room; she had
waited as eagerly for his coming as she had done during
the first days of their engagement. She, too, during
a sleepless night had resolved that the only
solution was a divorce, but she was going to have just
as gay a time out of the event as was possible, which
included making Steve as wretched as could be.
Even with the rumours concerning Mary she believed,
in the conceited fashion of all persons so cowardly
that they merely consent to be loved, that Steve still
adored her and that she was dealing with the deluded
man of a few years ago.</p>
<p>She wore a sapphire-coloured neglig&eacute; with slippers
to match, and lay in her chaise-longue gondola, her
prayer books with their silver covers and a new Pom
as touching details to the farewell tableau. Then
Steve was permitted to come into the room.</p>
<p>She gazed at him in a sorrowful, forgiving fashion,
quite enjoying the situation. Then she held out her
hand, wondering if he would kiss it; but he took it as
meaning that he might sit down or try to sit down on
a perilous little hassock which he had always named
the Rocky Road to Dublin despite its Florentine
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you agree with me,&rdquo; he began, in businesslike
fashion as he noted the prayer books, the untouched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
breakfast tray, the snapping Pom, which
never tolerated his presence without protest. &ldquo;I
am going to see your father, out of courtesy, and
explain more in detail how things stand. It won&rsquo;t
interest you so I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bore you. I have enough
money and securities to cover the loss of any of his
money. I shall apply for a position in another city.
I am reasonably sure of obtaining it. It seems to
me it would be better that I go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive you, Steve,&rdquo; she said, sadly, shaking her
golden head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you will want to do something about
a legal separation&ndash;&ndash;and if you do not I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prayer books fell to the floor in collision with
the slipping Pom but Beatrice did not notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you do love her!&rdquo; There was a hint of a snarl
in her high-pitched voice. &ldquo;So you want to marry
her after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Steve continued, in the same even voice,
&ldquo;that as you are going to tire of being a divorcee
playing about, and will want a second husband to
help with the ennui that is bound to occur, you had
best select your form of a divorce and let me do what
I can to aid in the matter. You are very lovely this
morning, as you usually are. There is no doubt but
what many men far better suited to you than I will
try to have you marry them&ndash;&ndash;they will wisely never
expect to marry you. That was our great mistake,
Beatrice. I thought I was marrying you&ndash;&ndash;but you
were really marrying me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you do love her,&rdquo; she repeated, paying no
heed to what else he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; Steve said, with sudden honesty.
It was a relief to be as brutal and uncomplimentary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
as possible; it offset the silver-covered prayer books,
the breakfast tray, the bejewelled Pom, the whole
studied, inane effect of a discontented woman trying
to play coquette up to the last moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have loved her a long time. I could no more
have refrained from it than you can refrain from
feeling a pique at the fact, though you have nothing
but contempt for us both and only a passing interest
if the truth were known. I am glad you have persisted
in asking me until I told you. I think one
of the most promising signs that women will survive
is the fact that they are never afraid to ask questions,
no matter how delicate the situation. Men keep
silence and often bring disaster on their sulky heads
as a result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&ndash;&ndash;and you dare tell me this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. I dare to tell you the truth,
which no one else has ever taken the pains to tell you.
If you do not get a divorce I intend to. Not that I
champion the custom as a particularly healthy institution,
but it is sometimes a necessary one. If it is
any satisfaction to you I do not think Miss Faithful
has the slightest idea of marrying me. She has put
that part of her aside for business and taking care of
Luke. The time has passed when she would have
married me. Still, I shall try to make her change her
mind,&rdquo; he added with the same spirit he had once
displayed toward winning the Gorgeous Girl. &ldquo;Only
this time I shall not bargain for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice gave an affected laugh. &ldquo;Quite a satisfactory
arrangement all round. I hope you do not
bother me again. Tell my father what you like,
and then take yourself off to the new position and do
as you please. When I decide what course I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
pursue you will be informed. Would you please pick
up my prayer book?&rdquo; she added, languidly.</p>
<p>Steve bent over to grasp the intricate nothing in
his hand and lay it gently in the sapphire-velvet lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Beatrice,&rdquo; he said, a trifle sadly&ndash;&ndash;for
the day the child discovers there are no fairies is one
of sadness.</p>
<p>It was something of this Steve felt as he looked
at his wife for the last time. How thrilled and adoring
he would have one time been. Just such visions,
a trifle cruder no doubt, had stirred his young soul
in the bleak orphanage days&ndash;&ndash;the boo&rsquo;ful princess
and the valiant young hero chaining the seven-headed
dragon. And in America it was just bound to have
come true!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Stevuns,&rdquo; she answered, in the same
gay voice&ndash;&ndash;but a trifle forced if one knew her well.
&ldquo;I hope you have a wonderful time leading a mob
somewhere and your wife selling your photographs
on the next corner curbstone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pretended to become interested in the prayer
book; and, with the Pom shooing him out by sharp,
ear-piercing barks, Steve left the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Not an hour later Mrs. Stephen O&rsquo;Valley&rsquo;s
card was taken in to Mary Faithful as she
sat trying to work in the new office&ndash;&ndash;it never
ceased to be new to her. She had heard the swift
rumours of Steve&rsquo;s failure. Understanding that the
visitor&rsquo;s card had a deeper significance than the messenger
who delivered it realized, Mary closed the
outer doors of her office and waited for her guest.</p>
<p>It was a very Gorgeous Girl who swept serenely
into the room and lost no time in introducing the
nature of her errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how well informed you are in business
reports,&rdquo; she began in her high-pitched voice,
&ldquo;but perhaps you have heard&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The report of the new leather trust&ndash;&ndash;without
including your husband&rsquo;s factory? Yes&ndash;&ndash;but it was
bound to come. I always told him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice lost sight of the business introduction
she had so carefully planned while dressing and then
driving downtown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have told my husband a great many things,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be surprised.
I am quite well informed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was scrutinizing Mary as she talked. Within
her mind was the undeniable thought that there was
something about this thin, tall woman with gray eyes
which was real and comforting. She even wished
that Steve had fallen in love with someone else, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
that she, Beatrice, might have come to Mary for
comfort and advice. If any one could have set her
right with herself it would be just such a good-looking
thing, as Trudy used to say, a commercial nun who
had kept her ideals and was not bereft of ideas. Faith
and intellect had been properly introduced in Mary&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>Mary blushed. &ldquo;I have always wished to speak
to you about something Mrs. Vondeplosshe told you
shortly before her death. Won&rsquo;t you sit down? I
am sure we have much to say to each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice found herself obeying like a docile child.
As she took a chair facing Mary&rsquo;s desk she realized
that in just such a kind, practical fashion would Mary
proceed to manage Steve, that the years of experience
in the business world as an independent woman would
give Mary quite a new-fashioned charm in his eyes.
Whether she was dealing with gigantic business interests
in deft fashion or showing tenderness for the
little girl who puts away her dolls for the last time,
Mary possessed a flexibility of comprehension and
power. One could not be cheap in dealings with
her. And as the eternal sex barrier was not present
in Beatrice&rsquo;s behalf she realized that her jargon so
impulsively planned would never be said. Nor could
she dismiss Mary patronizingly and say the halfway
melodramatic things she had said to Steve. It occurred
to her as Mary began to talk that Mary had
been brave enough to love, not merely be loved, the
truth of this causing her to wince within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a malicious moment Trudy told you of my&ndash;&ndash;my
affection for your husband. It is true, if that is
what you have come to ask me about. I told myself
months ago that if you did come to ask me this thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
I should answer you truthfully, and we must remain
at least polite acquaintances over a hard situation. I
think I have played fairly.&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s face had a tired
look that bore proof to the statement. &ldquo;I even left
his employ. As I once told you from an impersonal
statement, I have a theory that many business
women of to-day are in love with someone in their
office. Propinquity perhaps and the shut-in existence
that they lead account for much of it. Yet no
woman is a true woman who forgets her employer is a
married or engaged man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I know, however, that love does not
stop to ask if this is the case, and I sometimes feel&ndash;&ndash;impersonally,
remember&ndash;&ndash;that the business women
earn the love of their employers and associates more
than said employers&rsquo; and associates&rsquo; wives. Does
it sound strange? Of course you need not agree&ndash;&ndash;I
hardly expect it. Yet the fact remains that we
watch and save that you Gorgeous Girls may spend
and play. In time the man, tense and non-understanding
of it all, discovers that his trust and confidence
may be placed in the business woman while
romantic love is not enduring in his home. Not
always, of course; but many times in these days of
overnight prosperity and endless good times. So I
have neither shame nor remorse&ndash;&ndash;I have as much
right to love your husband as you have&ndash;&ndash;and because
of that I shall be as fair to you as I would ask
any woman to be toward me in similar circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; the Gorgeous Girl said,
swiftly. &ldquo;I see something of the light.&rdquo; She
laughed nervously. It was easier to laugh than to
cry, and one or the other was necessary at this moment.
&ldquo;I wanted to tell you that my husband is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
going away to take a rather mediocre position. I
shall divorce him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s won out,&rdquo; Mary said, in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he? So you have been the urge behind him
and his poverty talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to claim the credit,&rdquo; Mary retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice found herself in another mental box,
undecided how to cope with the situation. She had
fancied she could make Mary cry and beg for silence,
be afraid and unpoised. Instead she felt as ornate as
a circus rider in her costume, and as stupid regarding
the truth as the snapping Pom under her arm. Her
head began to ache. She wondered why all these
people delighted in accepting sacrifice and seeking
self-denial&ndash;&ndash;and she thought of Gay again and of
what a consolation he was. And through it all ran
a curious mental pain which informed her that she
had not the power to hurt or to please either of these
persons, and she was being politely labelled and put
in her own groove by Mary Faithful. This stung
her on to action, just as any poorly prepared enemy
loses his head when he sees the tide is turning.</p>
<p>In desperation she said, coldly: &ldquo;After all, I shall
play square with you because you have played square
with him. I&rsquo;ll give you the best advice a retiring wife
can give her advancing rival. Don&rsquo;t copy me&ndash;&ndash;no
matter how Steve may prosper in years to come,
do you understand? Oh, I&rsquo;m not so terrible or abnormal
as you people think. I&rsquo;d have done quite
well if my father had never earned more than three
thousand a year and I had had to put my shoulder
to the wheel. But don&rsquo;t ever start to be a Gorgeous
Girl&ndash;&ndash;stay thrifty and be not too discerning of handmade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
lace or lap dogs. You know, there&rsquo;s no need
to enumerate. Stay the woman who won my husband
away from me&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;ll keep him. What
is more, I think you will make him a success&ndash;&ndash;in
time for your golden-wedding anniversary! There,
that&rsquo;s as fair as I can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo; Mary said, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once you admit to him there is a craving in your
sensible heart to be as useless as I am&ndash;&ndash;then someone
else will come along to play Mary Faithful to your
Gorgeous Girl.&rdquo; There was a catch in the light, gay
voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him,&rdquo; she added, vigorously.
&ldquo;Heavens, no, we never could patch it up! I shall
always think of this last twelve months as <i>l&rsquo;ann&eacute;e
terrible!</i> My Tawny Adonis was a far more soothing
companion than Steve. Nor do I envy you and your
future. I don&rsquo;t really want Steve&ndash;&ndash;and you deserve
him. Besides, we women never feel so secure as
novelists like to paint us as being in their last chapters!
So I&rsquo;m giving you the best hint concerning
our mutual cave man that a defeated Gorgeous Girl
ever gave a Mary Faithful. As far as I am concerned
the thing is painless. I shall have a ripping time out
West, and some day perhaps marry someone nice
and mild, someone who will stand for my moods
and not spend too much of my money in ways I don&rsquo;t
know about&ndash;&ndash;a society coward out of a job! The
thing that does hurt,&rdquo; she finished, suddenly, &ldquo;is
the fact that I&rsquo;d honestly like to feel broken-hearted&ndash;&ndash;but
I don&rsquo;t know how. I&rsquo;ve been brought up
in such a gorgeous fashion that it would take a
jewel robbery or an unbecoming hat to wring my
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Mary said, lightly. &ldquo;I may as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
tell you I&rsquo;ve determined never to marry Steve, for all
your good advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; All the tenseness of her nature rushed
to the occasion. This was decidedly interesting,
since it resembled her own whims. She felt almost
friendly toward the other woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Mary answered, handing the psychologists
another problem for a rainy afternoon.</p>
<p>Beatrice nodded, satisfied at the answer and the
eternal damnable woman&rsquo;s notion inspiring it, for
it was just what she would have replied in like circumstances.
She felt there was nothing more to be
said about the matter and that Gorgeous Girls and
commercial nuns had much in common. As usual,
Steve was appointed the official blackguard of the
inevitable triangle!</p>
<p>Going home that night Mary felt that truly the
&ldquo;day was a bitter almond.&rdquo; It even began to be
dramatically muggy and threatening, in keeping
with her state of mind&ndash;&ndash;the sort of forced weather
that issues offstage in roars of thunder the moment
the villain begins his plotting. She took a street
car, having meant to walk and give herself time to
pull together and adopt the fat smile of a professional
optimist.</p>
<p>A tired-faced woman, heavily rouged, was talking
to another tired-faced woman, also rouged. Mary
listened because it was a relief to listen to someone
else besides herself, to realize there were other persons
in this world occupied with other problems besides a
commercial nun with a heartache, a tired cave man
about to start again, and a Gorgeous Girl defeated
in no uncertain terms. The whole thing was beyond
Mary&rsquo;s comprehension just now; as much as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
graybeards&rsquo; lack of understanding when they try to
Freud the schoolboy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, too, Mame, all over&ndash;&ndash;and when she
tried telling me she was a natural blonde, never using
lemon juice in even the last rinse water&ndash;&ndash;well, when
you&rsquo;ve been handing out doll dope and baby bluster
over the counter of a beauty department as long as I
have you know there ain&rsquo;t no such animal! Good-bye,
Mame. I hope you get home safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such animal,&rdquo; Mary found herself
repeating. &ldquo;No, there sure ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no real commercial nuns; it was a
premeditated affair entirely, merely a comfortable
phrase borrowed by the lonesome ones unwilling to be
called old maids; a big, brave bluff that women have
adopted during these times of commercial necessity
and economic stress. Commercial nuns! As foolish
as the tales told children of the wunks living in the
coalbins&ndash;&ndash;as if there ever could be such creatures!
The reason Mary would not marry Steve was because
she, Mary, did not want to disappoint him even
as the Gorgeous Girl had done. She did not want
to be all helpmate, practical comrade; she had fed herself
with this delusion during the years of loneliness.
She had adopted the veneer, convinced herself that it
was true, but she knew now that it was false. It had
taken a Gorgeous Girl to scratch beneath the veneer
in true feminine fashion. Mary did wish to be
dependent, helpless&ndash;&ndash;to have Gorgeous Girl propensities.
The cheap phrases of the shopwomen
kept interrupting her attempts to think of practical
detail. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no such animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found Luke wild-eyed and excited, brandishing
an evening paper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look what&rsquo;s happened&ndash;&ndash;the O&rsquo;Valley Leather
Company has gone under! Won&rsquo;t Constantine help
him out? I always said you were the mascot&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? I always tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary smiled. Luke was so boyish and square.
She felt that particularly toward Luke must she keep
up the delusion of being a commercial nun, content
with her part in things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a horrid day. I rode on a car that was
as crowded as a cattle shipment. My head aches.
The stenographer has left to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you are not interested about Steve
O&rsquo;Valley?&rdquo; Luke was not to be trifled with regarding
the affair.</p>
<p>Mary sank down into the nearest chair. &ldquo;Of
course I am. But what right have I to be?&rdquo; she
asked, almost bitterly. &ldquo;It never pays to be too
keenly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke laid the paper aside. &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he began,
his voice very basso profondo, &ldquo;do you like this
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary gave a little cry. &ldquo;Stop&ndash;&ndash;all of you&ndash;&ndash;all
of you!&rdquo; Then she began sobbing quite as helplessly
as the Gorgeous Girl could have done.</p>
<p>Luke stood before her in helpless posture. He
might have coped with her temper but his reliable
tailor-made sister in tears?&ndash;&ndash;Never. As she cried
he experienced a new sympathy, a delightful sense of
protectorship. He decided that his wife should cry
occasionally&ndash;&ndash;it became women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he began, shyly, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t cry
about him; it won&rsquo;t do any good. If he has failed
it isn&rsquo;t your fault. And if you do like him&ndash;&ndash;well, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
like him. He likes you,&rdquo; he finished with emphasis.
&ldquo;I know it. I&rsquo;ve known it all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Luke!&rdquo; Mary said, helplessly. &ldquo;Luke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his arm round her, clumsily. &ldquo;There&ndash;&ndash;now
I wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;please don&rsquo;t, it makes me feel awful
bad&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s no sense worrying about it&ndash;&ndash;you have
a lot of good things ahead of you. There, that&rsquo;s
the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Luke grew up and became far
more manly and self-sufficient than all Mary&rsquo;s
practical naggings and deeply laid plans could have
achieved. He felt he must protect his sister; hitherto
it had been his sister who had protected him. And he
watched with pride the way she smiled up through
her tears in rainbow fashion and patted his cheek,
calling him a dear. She was a new kind of Mary.
Both of them felt the better for the happening.</p>
<p>But when Steve came unceremoniously to Mary&rsquo;s
apartment that same evening, and Luke, very amusing
and pathetic in his dignity, met him, innocent of
the tornado of emotion sweeping about his nice boyish
self&ndash;&ndash;Mary almost wished the happening had not
taken place. For a moment she feared that Luke
would try to take command of the situation. There
was something maternal in Mary&rsquo;s wishing Luke to
be ignorant of the hard things until the ripe time
should come. And Luke, quite willing to be released,
since it was a trifle beyond his powers of comprehension,
retired to read a magazine and resolve to be
ready for action at the first sound of a sister&rsquo;s sob!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to come,&rdquo; Steve said, simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
like the man who never took time to walk because he
had always been so busy running. I want to walk
but I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></div>
<p>Mary shook her head, really shaking it at herself.
&ldquo;Go away, Steve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall, after a little. But I had to come now.
Her aunt said she saw you and made quite a time
of it. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. We are good friends, in a sense; far
better than we have ever been before. We found we
were in accord&ndash;&ndash;after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her in the same helpless fashion Luke
had adopted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will divorce you and marry someone else and
continue to be a Gorgeous Girl,&rdquo; Mary finished,
quietly. &ldquo;No terrible fate will overtake her, nothing
occur to rouse or develop her abilities. She will remain
young and apparently childish until she suddenly
reaches the stately dowager age overnight.
Gorgeous Girls are like gypsies&ndash;&ndash;they should either
be very young and lissom or old, crinkled, and vested
with powers of fortune-telling&ndash;&ndash;the middle stage is
impossible. I realized this morning that I&rsquo;ve been
fooling myself, all the heart in me trying to be
100 per cent efficient, when I really want to be a
Gorgeous Girl&ndash;&ndash;fluffy, helpless&ndash;&ndash;a blooming little
idiot. And I&rsquo;m glad you have come so I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; he corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being incurably honest I am bound to tell tales
on myself. Yes, I do mean it. I&rsquo;d probably be
rushing round for freckle lotion and patent nose pins,
to give me a Greek-boy effect. I&rsquo;d take to swathing
myself in chiffons and have my hair a different tint
each season. I think every business woman would
do the same, too&ndash;&ndash;if she had the chance. We have to
fool ourselves to keep on going down the broad highway;
or else we would be sanitarium devotees,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
neurasthenic muddles. So we strike our brave pose
and call ourselves superwomen, advanced feminists,
and all the rest of the feeble rubbish until the right
man comes along. Sometimes he never comes&ndash;&ndash;so
we keep right ahead, growing dry as dust at heart
and even fooling ourselves. I did. But it took
your wife to show me my smug conceit, my fancy that
I was a bulwark of commerce, so proper, so perfect!
She showed me that I was just plain woman making
the best of having been born into the twentieth
century! There is a Gorgeous Girl in all of us, Steve.
So I can&rsquo;t advise or comfort or do any of the things I
used to&ndash;&ndash;a bag of tricks we women in business have
adopted to make the heart loneliness the less. Go
away and make good! That is just what she told
you&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t it? You will never believe in any of us
again. And I don&rsquo;t know that you should, after all.
For cave men need Gorgeous Girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve was laughing down at her. &ldquo;True&ndash;&ndash;but
they need the right Gorgeous Girl. I&rsquo;m glad you
have finally told the truth; I always suspected it.
You have over-emphasized it somewhat&ndash;&ndash;and the
woman I married was unfairly over-emphasized as
well. But in the main, what you have said is the
truth. I assure you I am twice as glad to have an
incentive instead of a lady directress. And I want
you to be helpless&ndash;&ndash;if you can; and fluffy&ndash;&ndash;if you
will! Don&rsquo;t you see that you are the right Gorgeous
Girl&ndash;&ndash;and she was the wrong one&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m the culprit?
Why, Mary, the worst thing you could do
would be to descend upon me in curl papers under a
pink net cap. Even that prospect does not frighten
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; she asked, shyly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not far&ndash;&ndash;nothing spectacular or romantic. I&rsquo;m
done with that. Beatrice goes West, I believe.
She is quite happy. She is going to New York first
to get her divorce wardrobe. It is her father I pity&ndash;&ndash;he
has to face another son-in-law,&rdquo; Steve laughed.
&ldquo;I am merely going to work for an old and reliable
firm&ndash;&ndash;use my nest egg for a house. A brown-shingled
house, I think, with plain yard and a few
ambitious shrubs blooming along the walks. I don&rsquo;t
know what they will be; I leave that to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luke wondered why he was not called upon for
action, but he wondered still more as Mary came
presently to ask that he tell Steve good-night. Her
gray eyes were like captured sunrise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke, dear,&rdquo; she said in as feminine a manner as
Beatrice might have done, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry about me
any more. I&rsquo;m a queer old sister&ndash;&ndash;but it&rsquo;s all
coming out all right,&rdquo; kissing him before Steve, to
his utter confusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Beatrice sent for Gay before she decided
to run down to New York to gather up some
good-looking things to wear while West.
More and more the novelty of the situation was
appealing to her. She would ship her car out and
take with her a maid, the Pom, and her aunt, besides
three trunks of clothes. She also had learned of
hot springs that were extremely reducing; and of a
wonderful lawyer whom several of her friends recommended.
It had grown very distressing to have a
cave man prowl about the villa, the eternal disapproval
of whatsoever she did, then her father&rsquo;s presence
got on her nerves. Considering everything she
was glad to escape, and she welcomed the sympathy
and peculiar publicity that would be hers. The r&ocirc;le
of an injured woman is almost as attractive as that of
a romantic parasite. All in all, she was just bound to
have a good time.</p>
<p>To be sure she thought of Steve working for someone
else, making one twentieth of his former income,
marrying Mary and starting housekeeping in eight
rooms and a pocket handkerchief of a lawn&ndash;&ndash;and she
envied them. This was only natural; it would be
fun to be in Mary&rsquo;s place for a fortnight or so, so she
could tell about it afterward. And she thought of
Mary and of all she had admitted in the tenseness
of their conversation.</p>
<p>When she returned from New York Gay met her at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
the train. He carried a single long-stemmed white
rose, which, he lisped, stood for friendship. And
Beatrice&ndash;&ndash;three pounds heavier if the truth were
told&ndash;&ndash;quite languid and easily pleased, looked
affectionately upon Gay, who was trying to smile
his sweetest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course this is very hard&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;feeling it the thing
to say&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always knew it,&rdquo; he supplemented, feeling that
the gates of paradise were slowly opening for him.
Within a year or so he would not even have the pretense
at a business. &ldquo;I understand only too well.
May I say to my old friend, one whose opinions have
swayed me far more than she has imagined, that I,
too, have experienced a similar disillusionment which
terminated more tragically?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Beatrice roused from her cushions.
&ldquo;Tell me, Gay, just when did you begin to regret
having married Trudy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barriers down, Gay began a rapid fire of incidents
concerning Trudy&rsquo;s gross nature and lack of
comprehension, and the patience it had required to
bear with her. He twirled her diamond ring on his
finger. Beatrice spied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that setting is just a little different from
any I have,&rdquo; she said, almost crossly. &ldquo;I never saw
it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand, and the minor question of a
dead wife and a discarded husband was put aside
until further ennui should overtake them.</p>
<p>Aunt Belle opposed the divorce trip more vigorously
than any one else concerned. It seemed to her
naught but a wild panorama of rattlesnakes and
Indians, with no opportunity for her daily massage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
Besides, she knew Beatrice&rsquo;s moods, and as time
went on, between Constantine&rsquo;s ridicule and his
daughter&rsquo;s tempers, Aunt Belle was forced to work
hard to maintain a look of joyous contentment.</p>
<p>But there was nothing else for her to do unless she
wished to be taken to an old ladies&rsquo; home. Her
brother had said he would be delighted to have her
away, her pretenses and simpering nothings drove
him to distraction; and he had at last secured a man
attendant who knew how to dodge small articles
skilfully for the compensation of a hundred dollars a
month and all he could pilfer. Like Beatrice, Aunt
Belle regretted that the actual divorce must lack a
gorgeous setting; it was quite commonplace. But
one cannot have everything, and Beatrice had as
much as hinted that for her second wedding she
would use the sunken gardens at the Villa Rosa and
wear a cloth-of-gold gown without a veil but a smart
aigrette of gilded feathers.</p>
<p>Beatrice shrank from saying good-bye to her father.
It was more than her usual dislike of entering the
sick room. She had come to realize that though her
father caused her to be the sort of person she was, he
himself had remained both real and simple, succeeding
by force of this fact, and her contact with both Steve
and Mary convinced her that she did not wish to
know real, everyday persons&ndash;&ndash;they had nothing in
common with her and caused her to be restless and
distressed. Gay was as wild a mental tonic as she
desired.</p>
<p>However, she bent solicitously over him and
murmured the usual things: &ldquo;Take best care of
yourself&ndash;&ndash;miss you worlds&ndash;&ndash;do be careful&ndash;&ndash;will
write every day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>Constantine looked up at her, tears in the harsh
eyes, which had lost their black sparkle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry,&rdquo; he said, in childish fashion, as she waited
for an equally conventional reply. &ldquo;Your mother
would have liked Steve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;shocked at his lack of fairness&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;how
horrid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was wrong&ndash;&ndash;maybe if your mother had
lived it would have been different. She would have
liked Steve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beatrice played her final weapon against Steve&rsquo;s
reputation in her father&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to marry Miss Faithful. He has
loved her for a long time. Now you see what I have
endured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite. He admitted it. So did she.&rdquo;
Beatrice knew that Mary&rsquo;s declaration against ever
marrying Steve would have as much effect as to
attempt to keep the sun from shining if it so inclined.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt they will be the model couple of a
model village, for if ever there was a reformer it is
Steve. He never should have been a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at thirty,&rdquo; his father-in-law championed.
&ldquo;So&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the woman who worked for him that
won.... I guess it&rsquo;s the way of things, Bea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You uphold him?&rdquo; Her temper was rising.</p>
<p>Constantine shook his head, closing the dull eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of it all,&rdquo; he excused himself. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a check for you on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either pretended or real, he seemed to go to sleep
without delay.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Some months later Gaylord, very suave in white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
flannels, came in to tell Constantino that he was to
meet Beatrice in Chicago, en route from the West, and
that they were planning to announce their engagement
shortly after their arrival in Hanover. At which
Constantine managed to curse Gay in as horrid
fashion as he knew how. But Gay was quite too
happy and secure to mind the reception. Besides,
there was nothing Constantine could do about it. It
was a rather neat form of revenge since his daughter
would bring into his family the son of one of the men
he had ruthlessly ruined in his own ascent of the
ladder.</p>
<p>Gay had done nothing but write letters to Beatrice,
in which he copied all the smart sayings and
quips of everyone else, purporting them as original,
impoverishing himself for florists&rsquo; orders and gifts,
and even taking a desperate run out to see Beatrice
ensconced in state in a Western town with her tortured
aunt and lady&rsquo;s maid and a stout squaw to do
the housekeeping. Gay knew that all this work
would not count in vain. So when he proposed to
Beatrice, having taken three days in which to write
the love missive, he knew that he would be accepted,
and therefore counted Constantine&rsquo;s wrath
as a passing annoyance.</p>
<p>Everything considered, Beatrice could do no better.
She had inclined toward a minister as a second husband,
she one time said, but her chances there were
small since she was not a bona-fide widow. Gay
would endure anything at her hands; he knew no
pride, he had no purpose in existing save to have a
good time, neither did he possess annoying theories
about life. He was an adept at flattery, and he
understood Beatrice&rsquo;s sensitiveness about being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
called stout. With a suitor at hand well trained for
the part, why waste time looking further, she argued.</p>
<p>So the wedding in the sunken gardens with the
cloth-of-gold-garbed bride was planned for the next
season&rsquo;s calendar and there would be all the pleasure
of talking it over, the entertainments, the new clothes,
and so on. His father-in-law was paralyzed and his
aunt-in-law was senile. Gay was bound to be master
of all he surveyed before long.</p>
<p>Perhaps during the breaking up of his establishment
he might be unpleasantly reminded of a red-haired
girl who had died unmourned and whose very
ring Beatrice now wore&ndash;&ndash;in exchange for one of hers
which Gay wore. But he could take an extra cordial
if that was the case and soon forget. After all, Trudy,
like Steve, had been impossible; and Gay felt positive
that impossible people would not count at judgment
day.</p>
<p>Likewise Beatrice, who regarded the whole thing
as a lark, thought sometimes of Steve, who, she understood,
was superintendent of a large plant some two
hundred miles removed from Hanover, and of the
time when the slightest flicker of her eyes made him
glad for all the day, or the suggestion of a pout
brought him to the level of despair. Perhaps she
thought, too, of the very few moments as his wife during
which she had wished things might have been as
he wanted. No, not really wished&ndash;&ndash;but wondered
how it would have been. And of Mary she thought
a great deal&ndash;&ndash;that was to be expected. No one
wrote her about Mary, no one seemed to think it
would be interesting. The dozen dear friends who
deluged her with weekly items of local scandal never
once told her of her wife-in-law, as Gay dubbed her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
Therefore she thought of her more than she did of
any one else&ndash;&ndash;even Gay.</p>
<p>She wondered if Mary was making simple hemstitched
things for her trousseau; if she would shamelessly
marry this divorced man, superintendent of a
cement works; if she would go live in a brown-shingled
house and belong to the town social centre
and all the rest of the woman&rsquo;s-column, bargain-day,
sewing-society things. And Beatrice knew that
Mary would. Moreover, that she would make a
complete success of so doing. Whereas even now
Beatrice merely regarded Gay as essential to complete
her defeat.</p>
<p>When she reached home, in company with Gay,
her aunt, the maid, and an armful of flowers, the
attendant told them her father was dead. He had
had a bad turn in the early morning&ndash;&ndash;no pain&ndash;&ndash;just
drifted off. Well, the only intelligible things he had
said were&ndash;&ndash;should he repeat them now? Well, the
two words he had said over and over again were
&ldquo;Steve&ndash;&ndash;Hannah&ndash;&ndash;Hannah&ndash;&ndash;Steve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the cloth-of-gold wedding with the sunken-garden
setting was changed for a wedding at twilight
in the conservatory, Beatrice dressed in shimmery
mauve out of memory to dear papa!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;You have renounced your economic independence
and you are now approaching the legal-vassal
stage,&rdquo; Steve warned Mary as they viewed the rooms
of the new brown house. &ldquo;Do you know what it all
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; probably that is why we women do so,&rdquo; she
retorted. &ldquo;Luke says you are bully and everything
is fino&ndash;&ndash;and I set quite a store by Luke&rsquo;s opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have green-plush and golden-oak people
call on you, I&rsquo;m afraid, and a few who run to Sheraton
and crystal goblets. There will be funny entertainments
and dinner parties where the hostess fries the
steak and then removes her apron to display her best
silk gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am prepared. And the maid will leave us before
the month is over and I shall be her understudy.
Well, I can. That is something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to ask permission to smoke&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
going to sprawl in all the chairs and puff away at my
leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do. I&rsquo;ll try to remember it is good for moths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, are you satisfied?&rdquo; he asked, wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. It never does to have it all perfect&ndash;&ndash;to
the last detail of the wallpaper designs. That
never lasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to lay her head on his shoulder for a brief
second, almost boyishly darting away and running
upstairs to see to some detail in which Steve was not
concerned.</p>
<p>He went to the side doorway of the house to
look out at the other houses and yards&ndash;&ndash;pleasant,
livable dwellings without romantic construction or
extravagant details&ndash;&ndash;the homes of the people who
keep the world moving and mostly turning to the
right.</p>
<p>He felt he had earned this brown house&ndash;&ndash;and the
woman who was upstairs examining the linen-closet
capacity. He had neither stolen nor bargained for
either. It was true there was a tinge of regret, like a
calm stretch of road without the suggestion of a
stirring breeze. One cannot chain youth, romance,
and Irish-Basque ancestry together and let them go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
breakneck speed without glorious and eternal memories
of the feat.</p>
<p>Mary realized this&ndash;&ndash;even though she might pretend
ignorance of the fact. She had reckoned with
it before she gave Steve her word. Perhaps it, too,
had been a factor in stripping off the mask of commercial
nun and showing him the Gorgeous-Girl propensities.
Nothing would content him so much as
to think of someone dependent upon him, make him
shoulder responsibility, surround him in a halo of
hero worship. Even if they both knew this to be a
lovely rosy joke&ndash;&ndash;aide-de-camp of romance, which
even the most practical American woman will not
forgo&ndash;&ndash;Mary had been wise in telling him the truth.
The only time women do at all well in fibbing is
to each other. Besides, there is a vast difference
between fibs and rosy jokes!</p>
<p>Steve had earned this, therefore it would be his
for all time. And though he felt youth had gone from
him&ndash;&ndash;the optimistic swashbuckling youth which
conquered all in his pathway&ndash;&ndash;approaching middle
age was good to have, and he rejoiced that this mad
noonday was over. As he looked out at the simple
grounds and thought of how sensible Mary was, and
how sensible was the colour of their modest car, and a
hundred similar facts&ndash;&ndash;there crossed his mind a
vision of the Gorgeous Girl like a frail, exotic jungle
flower, clad in copper-coloured tulle with tiny rusty
satin slippers and surrounded by a bodyguard of the
season&rsquo;s best dancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Stevuns,&rdquo; he almost fancied her light, gay
voice saying, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you funny!&rdquo; Then the tiny
rusty satin slippers tripped away to the latest of
waltz tunes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>Well, that was at an end. Perhaps even to Mary,
who had come downstairs, delighted at finding extra
shelf room, Steve would never confide these fleeting
visions that would cross his mind from time to time;
also his banished boy heart. Mary would grow a
trifle matronly of figure, become addicted to severe
striped silks, perhaps insist on meatless days&ndash;&ndash;and
smokeless rooms, for all she said not just now. She
would dominate a trifle and be on committees, raise
a great hue and cry as to the right schools for the
children. But she would always be his Mary Faithful,
gray-eyed and incurably honest and loving him
without pause and without thought of her own
splendid self. Truly he was a fortunate man, for
though there is an abundance of Gorgeous Girls
these days there are seldom enough Mary Faithfuls
to go round.</p>
<p>But he would never tell even his nearest and dearest
of the visions. This would be Steve&rsquo;s one secret.</p>
<p>And as Steve thought sometimes of the Gorgeous
Girl in copper-coloured tulle and with a dancing
bodyguard, or in white fur coats being halfway
carried into her motor car, so would the Gorgeous
Girl sometimes find Gay and his simpering servility
quite beside her own thoughts. Once more she would
see Steve, young and flushed with a lover&rsquo;s dream!</p>
<p>The same germ of greatness in these Gorgeous
Girls as in their fathers frequently causes them to
produce good results in the lives of those they
apparently harm. As in Steve&rsquo;s case&ndash;&ndash;he found his
ultimate salvation not so much by Mary Faithful&rsquo;s
love and service as by realizing the Gorgeous Girl&rsquo;s
shallow tragedy. With iron wills concealed behind
childish faces and misdirected energy searching for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
novelty, so the Gorgeous Girls stand to-day a deluxe
monument to the failure of their adoring, check-bestowing,
shortsighted parents. They are neither
salamanders nor vampires. Steve had not spoken
truly. They are more chaste and generous of heart
than the former, more aloof from sordid things than
the latter. Wonderful, curious little creatures with
frail, tempting physiques and virile endurance, playing
whatever game is handy without remorse and
without vicious intent just as long as it interests
them&ndash;&ndash;in the same careless fashion their fathers
stoked an engine or became a baker&rsquo;s assistant as
long as it proved advantageous.</p>
<p>Moreover, they are so apart from the workaday
world that it is impossible to refrain from thinking of
them in unwise fashion&ndash;&ndash;even after life has fallen
into pleasant channels and the dearly beloved of all
the world is by one&rsquo;s side. So strong yet so weak, so
tantalizing yet generous, they have the power to
haunt at strange intervals and in strange fashion.
So it was with Steve. He could not experience a
storm of definite reproach at the thought of Beatrice&ndash;&ndash;nor
bitter hatred. Only a vague, lonesome
urge, which soon dulled beside the sharp commands of
common sense.</p>
<p>It was only Mary who was done with visions and
could give herself unreservedly to the making of her
home, the rearing of her family. But Mary had
realized her vision&ndash;&ndash;not relinquished it.</p>
